        <h2>Local Wisdom for Settlers</h2>
        <p>Learn basic German—it makes bureaucratic life smoother. Get a transit subscription; it’s cheaper than a car. Choose a hillside apartment for views, but note they may get frost earlier in winter.</p>
        <p>Explore vineyards on weekends; they’re practically in your backyard. Take advantage of Stuttgart’s cultural calendar to meet locals.</p>
        <p>Finally, embrace the balance—this is a city where you can design cars by day and sip Riesling at sunset.</p>

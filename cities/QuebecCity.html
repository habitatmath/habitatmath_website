<!-- QUEBEC CITY -->
<h1>🌟 Quebec City – Stone streets, snow, and storybook views</h1>
<p>
Cobblestones, citadel walls, and a river that loves drama. The old town is compact and vertical; legs get a workout. Cafés spill onto lanes in summer. Winter turns everything into a postcard. <span class="metric">Population ≈ 0.55M (metro)</span>. Tourism is steady but not overwhelming outside festivals.
</p>
<p>
French first, but English works fine in service areas. The skyline is dominated by the Château Frontenac. Parks and promenades hug the cliff edge. Local pride runs deep; food is hearty and clever. It’s Europe-lite without the jet lag from North America.
</p>
<p>
Air is clean, streets feel safe, and the river keeps the weather interesting. Costs are friendlier than Montreal’s core. If you like seasons with capital letters, welcome home.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
Winter is real and glorious. <span class="metric">Sub-zero days ≈ 120–150/yr</span>. Snow is a feature, not a bug. <span class="metric">Snowfall days ≈ 70–90/yr</span>. <span class="metric">Annual snow ≈ 250–320 cm</span>. January averages around <span class="metric">−12 °C</span>.
</p>
<p>
Summer is short and bright. <span class="metric">July highs ≈ 24–26 °C</span>. <span class="metric">Rainy days ≈ 150/yr</span> counting light showers. Sunshine totals about <span class="metric">1,900–2,000 h/yr</span>. Thunderstorms visit but don’t linger.
</p>
<p>
Spring and fall swing fast. Color season is spectacular for a few crisp weeks. Heat waves happen; plan shade days. River breezes make evenings cooler than inland.
</p>

<h2>🚍 Public Transport</h2>
<p>
RTC buses run the grid and the hills. Core routes hit <span class="metric">5–10 min</span> at peaks. Off-peak stretches to <span class="metric">10–20 min</span>. <span class="metric">500+ km</span> of routes cover most neighborhoods. Real-time info is reliable.
</p>
<p>
A monthly pass runs about <span class="metric">C$95–105</span>. Day passes pay off after three rides. Park-and-ride is common for commuters. Bike lanes expand yearly; e-bikes help with slopes.
</p>
<p>
Airport sits ~<span class="metric">15 km</span> from Old Quebec. Express buses and shuttles fill the gap. Intercity coaches and VIA Rail tie into the station below the cliff.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays & Daily Costs</h2>
<p>
Mid-range hotels land around <span class="metric">C$150–220/night</span>. Hostels from <span class="metric">C$35–50</span>. Old-town boutiques add charm and stairs. Peak winter carnival and summer weekends price higher.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Average commute <span class="metric">25–35 min</span>. Snow clearing is efficient; sidewalks lag after storms. Hospital network scores well; clinics are accessible.
</p>
<p>
Green space is generous along the cliff and river. Water is safe and good. COL is mid-Canada; QOL benefits from safety and scenery.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>
Safety index is high; violent crime is rare. Police and EMS are responsive. Winter driving is the main hazard—snow tires are law.
</p>
<p>
Schools perform well; French helps with paperwork. Many services are online; processing <span class="metric">2–4 weeks</span> typical. Healthcare access improves if you register early.
</p>
<p>
Public buildings are accessible; old-town stairs are not. Keep IDs and proof of address handy for anything official.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
Walk the Terrasse Dufferin for river drama. Take the funicular once; walk the rest. Time a visit for Carnival or fall colors. Layer clothing—even July nights can cool down by the river.
</p>
<p>
Eat tourtière, poutine, and sugar-shack desserts. Book Old-Town stays early. Photos pop after fresh snow or golden sunset.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
Pick a neighborhood near your slope tolerance. Invest in real winter boots and a parka. Learn basic French; life gets smoother fast.
</p>
<p>
Stock a small storm kit; outages are rare but winters are winters. Embrace river walks and long views—the city rewards regulars.

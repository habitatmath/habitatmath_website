    <h1>Old Stones, New Code: Tallinn’s Walls & Wireless</h1>
    <p>Tallinn pairs a UNESCO-listed medieval old town with a famously digital public sector. About <span class="metric">450,000</span> people call it home, and the startup density punches far above its weight. Cobblestones, spires, seaside breezes — and paperwork you can do online in pajamas.</p>
    <p>Climate is Baltic-mild: summer highs around <span class="metric">20–24°C</span>, winters near <span class="metric">-6–0°C</span> with handfuls of snowy days. Ferries knit Tallinn to Helsinki in roughly <span class="metric">2–2.5</span> hours — day trips are a local hobby.</p>
    <p>Neighborhoods vary from storybook (Vanalinn) to sleek (Rotermann, Noblessner). Coffee culture is lively; cinnamon rolls and black bread are non-negotiable.</p>

    <h2>Moving Around Without Missing a Beat</h2>
    <p>The tram-bus network is clean and frequent; core tram headways hit <span class="metric">5–10</span> minutes at peak. Registered city residents ride public transport free; visitors use simple reloadable cards or contactless taps.</p>
    <p>Tallinn Airport is close — about <span class="metric">4 km</span> from the center — with a direct tram link in ~<span class="metric">15–20</span> minutes. Rail Baltica is in the works; current trains cover Estonia reliably.</p>
    <p>Cycling grows each season with more protected lanes and a flat waterfront promenade. E-scooters fill quick gaps in summer.</p>

    <h2>Seasons in the Sun (and Snow)</h2>
    <p>Summer brings light till late, sidewalk cafés, and music festivals. Autumn cools to <span class="metric">8–15°C</span> with bright maples on Toompea. Winter runs <span class="metric">-6–0°C</span>, snow is periodic, and sea winds can nip — layers help.</p>
    <p>Precipitation spans the year with peaks in late summer and autumn. Sunshine is best May–August; daylight stretches long enough to make two evenings out of one.</p>
    <p>Air is briny-fresh on the waterfront; inland parks add calm. Expect crisp, photogenic mornings most of the year.</p>

    <h2>Landing Soft: Travel & Short Stays</h2>
    <p>Short-lets in the center often run <span class="metric">€70–€130</span>/night; hotels range from boutique to high-rise at <span class="metric">€110–€220</span>. Wi-Fi speeds commonly hit <span class="metric">100–500 Mbps</span>.</p>
    <p>Base near Old Town for drama, or Noblessner/Kalamaja for sea views, design shops, and warehouses-turned-galleries.</p>
    <p>Harbor terminals sit close to town; walking off a ferry into cobblestones feels delightfully on-brand.</p>

    <h2>Homes, Health & Paperwork</h2>
    <p>One-bedroom rents: center <span class="metric">€900–€1,300</span>/month, outside center <span class="metric">€650–€900</span>. Utilities for a 1-bed: <span class="metric">€120–€180</span>. Groceries for one: <span class="metric">€220–€320</span>/month.</p>
    <p>Healthcare blends public and private clinics; English is common. City and national e-services (ID cards, e-prescriptions) make admin quick.</p>
    <p>Universities, coworking hubs, and meetups keep the calendar busy; expat communities are active and welcoming.</p>

    <h2>Safe Streets & Social Scenes</h2>
    <p>Safety is strong in central areas; nights are lively but civil. Police presence is visible around the old town during peak seasons.</p>
    <p>Social life stretches from medieval-cellar bars to seafront breweries and design markets. Parks and beaches (Pirita, Stroomi) fill sunny days.</p>
    <p>Integration is smooth; a few Estonian phrases go a long way, but English works in most daily interactions.</p>

    <h2>Extra Pointers for Visitors</h2>
    <p>Climb Toompea for spires and sea views. Tram to Kadriorg for palaces, parkland, and a quiet museum day. Ferry to Helsinki for a two-capital weekend.</p>
    <p>Eat rye bread with butter like you mean it. Try sprat sandwiches and kohuke for dessert. Coffee? Always yes.</p>
    <p>Winter tip: cobblestones + frost = sensible boots. Your ankles will write you a thank-you note.</p>

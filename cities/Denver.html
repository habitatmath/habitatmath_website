<h1>Denver – Mile-High skies, sunshine surplus, mountain minutes</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  The Mile-High City sits at <span class="metric">1,609 m</span> with <span class="metric">~715,000</span> residents; the metro passes 
  <span class="metric">~3.0M</span>. Red-brick warehouses became coffee labs, breweries, and galleries. Rockies on the horizon set a daily mood.
</p>
<p>
  AQI is usually <span class="metric">25–45</span>, with occasional wildfire haze in late summer. Downtown-to-neighborhoods is a quick hop: 
  LoDo lively, RiNo artsy, Wash Park jogger nation.
</p>
<p>
  Sport is civic religion. So are patios. Sunshine shows up like it’s on payroll.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
  Semi-arid snap. Winter highs <span class="metric">5–10 °C</span>, nights dip below freezing on 
  <span class="metric">60–90 days/yr</span>. Annual snowfall averages <span class="metric">120–150 cm</span> with 
  <span class="metric">25–30 snow days</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Summers run <span class="metric">28–33 °C</span>; heat waves over <span class="metric">35 °C</span> happen but are dry. 
  Sunshine boasts <span class="metric">3,000+ h/yr</span>. Annual precipitation sits around <span class="metric">350–400 mm</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Spring can snow, then melt by lunch. Fall is leaf-glow + perfect tailgate weather.
</p>

<h2>🚊 Public Transit Snapshot</h2>
<p>
  RTD runs light rail + commuter rail + buses. The A-Line airport train hits Union Station in 
  <span class="metric">~37 min</span> with <span class="metric">15–30 min</span> headways.
</p>
<p>
  Monthly passes range about <span class="metric">$88–$176</span> by zone. Frequent bus corridors thread most neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>
  Bike network keeps growing—<span class="metric">200+ miles</span> of lanes/trails. Scooters fill the last mile.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Getting There & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>
  DEN is big and busy, <span class="metric">~40 km</span> from downtown. Trains are easiest; rideshare takes 
  <span class="metric">30–45 min</span> off-peak.
</p>
<p>
  Hotels: mid-range <span class="metric">$150–220/night</span>, boutique/luxe from <span class="metric">$280+</span>. 
  Hostels/private rooms <span class="metric">$60–110</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Tacos <span class="metric">$3–5</span> each, craft beer pint <span class="metric">$6–8</span>, solid dinner for two 
  <span class="metric">$70–110</span>. Day budget without Broncos tickets: <span class="metric">$90–160</span>.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
  1-bed central <span class="metric">$1,800–2,400/mo</span>; outside core <span class="metric">$1,400–1,900</span>. 
  Utilities with winter heat <span class="metric">$130–200/mo</span>. Internet <span class="metric">300–1,000 Mbps</span> 
  for <span class="metric">$50–80</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Groceries for two <span class="metric">$600–900/mo</span>. Commutes average <span class="metric">20–40 min</span>. 
  Tap water is crisp; parks and trails web the city.
</p>
<p>
  QOL shines if you like blue skies, sports, and weekend mountain escapes. Snow plows earn their keep; streets rebound fast.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Generally safe with downtown hot spots; typical big-city awareness applies. Hospitals and urgent care are widespread.
</p>
<p>
  Universities anchor research and arts. Paperwork standard; front-range counties run services efficiently.
</p>
<p>
  Altitude is real—hydrate early week one. Sunscreen isn’t optional at 1,609 m.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  Start at Union Station, then stroll the 16th Street spine. Golden Triangle museums on a breezy afternoon; Red Rocks for sunset if shows align.
</p>
<p>
  Day trips: Golden breweries, Boulder hikes, Georgetown Loop Railroad. If it snows, wait two hours—then watch streets reappear.
</p>
<p>
  Book ski shuttles ahead; I-70 traffic has its own mythology. Brunch? Lines decide—arrive early, or eat tacos first.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Live near your preferred corridor—A-Line, Colfax frequent bus, or a bike greenway. Choose heat type wisely; winters test furnaces.
</p>
<p>
  Keep an emergency trunk kit: scraper, gloves, blanket. Learn the snow-parking rules by heart.
</p>
<p>
  Build a weekend mountain rhythm: early out, early back. And yes, everyone owns microspikes—join the club.

  <!-- MADRID -->
  <h1>Madrid — Sunlit plazas, late dinners, and art for days</h1>

  <h2>City Beat (not your typical intro)</h2>
  <p>
    Spain’s capital runs on energy and espresso, counting <span class="metric">~3.3M</span> residents in the city and <span class="metric">~6.7M</span> in the metro. 
    Sunshine is a lifestyle here with <span class="metric">2,900–3,000 h/yr</span>, and the sky wears blue like a uniform. 
    Air quality usually sits around <span class="metric">AQI 20–40</span>, better after a cleansing spring shower. 
    Tree shade matters: street trees fill <span class="metric">~250k</span> slots, and Retiro’s lake is your seasonal reset button. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Prado–Reina Sofía–Thyssen triangle is a world-class art sprint; football shrines complete the culture circuit. 
    Density is real but walkability wins—most central errands happen within <span class="metric">10–15 min</span>. 
    Bike lanes multiply yearly, and the city’s smart traffic systems keep the pulse mostly steady. 
    Terrace heaters plus long evenings equal dinners at <span class="metric">21:30–22:30</span> without apology.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s tidy, proud, and efficient under the jokes. If you need a skyline moment, head to the Cuatro Torres and count cranes—there are always a few.
  </p>

  <h2>Tracks, Buses, and Night Owls (Madrid in motion)</h2>
  <p>
    Metro de Madrid sprawls across <span class="metric">~294 km</span> and <span class="metric">300+ stations</span>, with peak headways of <span class="metric">2–4 min</span>. 
    Cercanías suburban rail ties in satellite towns at <span class="metric">100+ km/h</span> cruise speeds. 
    EMT buses blanket gaps and run night “búhos”; coverage feels total after the second churro.
  </p>
  <p>
    The integrated pass (Abono) for Zone A lands around <span class="metric">€20–€35</span> with age discounts; broader zones scale sensibly. 
    Airport Line 8 reaches Barajas in <span class="metric">~12–20 min</span>. 
    Public satisfaction sits high; even the notorious rush gets a punctuality score in the mid <span class="metric">90%</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bike sharing (BiciMAD) has <span class="metric">>7,000</span> bikes at <span class="metric">>600</span> docks; e-scooters live on the edges. 
    Commute medians hover at <span class="metric">30–40 min</span>, and a good transfer strategy beats traffic every time.
  </p>

  <h2>Weather, But Make It Feelable</h2>
  <p>
    Winters are brisk, not brutal: highs <span class="metric">8–12 °C</span>, <span class="metric">10–20</span> sub-zero mornings, and rare snow flurries. 
    Heating is efficient; sun still shows up for morale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spring opens fast with <span class="metric">15–22 °C</span> afternoons and parks exploding with runners. 
    Annual rain sums to <span class="metric">~430 mm</span> across <span class="metric">60–70</span> wet days—mostly brief showers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Summer is real: highs <span class="metric">32–36 °C</span>, spikes over <span class="metric">38 °C</span> possible during heatwaves. 
    Nights cool late; fans and siestas prove their worth. 
    UV is no joke—pack SPF like it’s paperwork.
  </p>
  <p>
    Autumn is generous: <span class="metric">18–26 °C</span> early on, golden light for days, and slow sunsets. 
    If you want the city at its best, circle October.
  </p>

  <h2>Touchdown, Check-in, Spend Smart</h2>
  <p>
    Barajas (MAD) sits <span class="metric">~12 km</span> from center; Metro 8 and Cercanías do the job in <span class="metric">20–30 min</span>. 
    Atocha and Chamartín handle high-speed rails to most of Spain, often under <span class="metric">3 h</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hotels range: budget <span class="metric">€70–110</span>, mid <span class="metric">€120–180</span>, luxe <span class="metric">€250+</span>. 
    Short-term rentals float around <span class="metric">€80–160/night</span> by barrio. 
    Coffee <span class="metric">€1.5–2.5</span>, menú del día <span class="metric">€12–16</span>, museum passes save real money.
  </p>
  <p>
    Daily visitor budget without splurges: <span class="metric">€70–120</span>. 
    Wi-Fi in cafés runs <span class="metric">100–600 Mbps</span>; co-working day passes from <span class="metric">€10–20</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>Rentals, Red Tape, Health & Study</h2>
  <p>
    1-bed central: <span class="metric">€1,100–1,700/mo</span>; outer districts: <span class="metric">€800–1,100</span>. 
    Deposits are usually <span class="metric">1–2 months</span>; utilities <span class="metric">€100–160</span>; fiber <span class="metric">€30–45</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Appointments (citas) matter; get them early. 
    Public healthcare is strong; private clinics cut wait times. 
    Universities and bootcamps pull a student crowd that keeps nights lively.
  </p>
  <p>
    QOL: high. Commute median <span class="metric">25–40 min</span>. 
    Groceries remain decent value; eating out scales fast in trendy zones.
  </p>

  <h2>Safety, Community, Recreation</h2>
  <p>
    Safety index sits around the high <span class="metric">60s–70s</span>; pickpockets target very touristy strips—zip everything. 
    Night streets feel lived-in, not empty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Integration is easy with language classes, running clubs, and endless meetups. 
    Festivals stack the calendar; weekends vanish into markets and concerts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recreation: <span class="metric">300+</span> km of parks and paths, municipal gyms from <span class="metric">€20–35/mo</span>, and day trips by high-speed rail that feel like cheating.
  </p>

  <h2>Services & Signals (the practical safety net)</h2>
  <p>
    112 works; pharmacies are plentiful and late in center. 
    Water is safe and tastes fine; heat alerts in July–August are routine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Street lighting is strong; CCTV scattered at major hubs. 
    Bike theft exists—two locks are culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    City apps cover transit, parking, and appointments; learn them, save hours.
  </p>

  <h2>Tourist Playbook</h2>
  <p>
    Prado early, Retiro mid-day, rooftop sunset—done. 
    Tapas crawl in La Latina; churros at midnight because why not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the 10-trip ticket if you’re hop-happy; Metro is faster than cabs at rush. 
    Plan one day for Toledo or Segovia (<span class="metric">30–45 min</span> by train).
  </p>
  <p>
    August is hot and quiet; December lights are peak cozy. 
    Book big museums online; lines are a lifestyle otherwise.
  </p>

  <h2>Long-Game Wisdom</h2>
  <p>
    Pick a barrio by noise curve: Malasaña parties; Chamberí whispers; Retiro families. 
    North-facing flats age better in summer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learn basic Spanish; life accelerates. 
    Build a routine: one market, one park, one café with your name on the cup.
  </p>
  <p>
    Day-trip habit keeps costs low and joy high—Spain by train is the cheat code.

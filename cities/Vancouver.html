    <h1>Rain & Range: Vancouver’s Greenways and Glass</h1>
    <p>Vancouver balances glassy skyline, temperate rainforest, and salt air. About <span class="metric">675,000</span> live in the city, with a metro of <span class="metric">~2.6 million</span>. Day-to-day life is outdoorsy: seawalls, beaches, and trailheads within transit reach, plus a food scene that’s quietly world-class.</p>
    <p>Climate is gentle by Canadian standards — summers run <span class="metric">21–26°C</span>, winters <span class="metric">3–8°C</span> with light snow every so often. Rain is a personality trait: roughly <span class="metric">1,100–1,300 mm</span> yearly and ~<span class="metric">150–170</span> wet days, which buy you <em>evergreen</em> everything.</p>
    <p>Transit is anchored by the driverless SkyTrain and a thick bus grid; cycling’s protected lanes and greenways link neighborhoods efficiently. Coffee is excellent and plentiful (a necessary partnership with the weather).</p>

    <h2>Moving Around Without Missing a Beat</h2>
    <p>SkyTrain’s Expo, Millennium, and Canada Lines hit core corridors with peak headways of <span class="metric">2–5</span> minutes. Day passes and contactless Compass payments keep fares simple; the SeaBus zips across Burrard Inlet to the North Shore.</p>
    <p>YVR airport sits ~<span class="metric">12 km</span> from downtown with a direct Canada Line train in ~<span class="metric">25–26</span> minutes. Regional buses reach ski towns; in winter, expect special shuttles to the slopes.</p>
    <p>Bike network tops <span class="metric">300+ km</span> of routes with growing protected segments; the Seawall is a scenic commute all by itself.</p>

    <h2>Seasons in the Sun (and Snow)</h2>
    <p>Summer: blue skies, mountain silhouettes, and mild heat. Autumn: fiery maples at <span class="metric">8–15°C</span>, early rains returning. Winter: <span class="metric">3–8°C</span> with drizzle, occasional snow, and local ski hills a <span class="metric">20–40</span> minute drive away.</p>
    <p>Sunshine clocks roughly <span class="metric">1,900–2,000</span> hours yearly; spring pops fast, with cherry blossoms flanking bikeways. Some late summers bring wildfire haze — check air quality on hot, still days.</p>
    <p>Waterproof layers > umbrellas on breezy seawalls. Shoes that tolerate puddles will become your best friends.</p>

    <h2>Landing Soft: Travel & Short Stays</h2>
    <p>Hotels vary from sleek downtown towers to boutique kits in Gastown and Yaletown; mid-range often lands <span class="metric">CAD $180–$300</span>/night. Short-lets vary by season, commonly <span class="metric">CAD $140–$260</span> per night. Wi-Fi speeds of <span class="metric">200–500 Mbps</span> are common in modern buildings.</p>
    <p>First-timers: base near the Seawall for car-free access to Stanley Park, beaches, and transit. North Shore stays are for hikers who want trailheads at the door.</p>
    <p>Airport arrival is easiest with a Compass-enabled tap onto the Canada Line; luggage space is built-in on most trains.</p>

    <h2>Homes, Health & Paperwork</h2>
    <p>One-bedroom rents: downtown <span class="metric">CAD $2,400–$3,200</span>/month; outside core <span class="metric">CAD $1,900–$2,600</span>. Utilities for a 1-bed: <span class="metric">CAD $100–$160</span>. Groceries for one: <span class="metric">CAD $350–$550</span>/month.</p>
    <p>Healthcare runs through provincial insurance; urgent-care clinics reduce ER waits and are common in central neighborhoods. Many city services and permits run smoothly online.</p>
    <p>Universities (UBC, SFU) and colleges amplify research, arts, and international communities across the metro.</p>

    <h2>Safe Streets & Social Scenes</h2>
    <p>Downtown cores are busy and well-lit; as in any big city, situational awareness matters. Transit is well-staffed, with cameras and frequent service on trunk lines.</p>
    <p>Social life = patios (when the sun’s out), breweries, food trucks, galleries, and parks. Beach volleyball, seawall jogs, and year-round cycling are default hobbies.</p>
    <p>Green is everywhere: Stanley Park’s rainforest, Pacific Spirit Park’s trails, and mountain views that steal entire afternoons.</p>

    <h2>Extra Pointers for Visitors</h2>
    <p>Walk the Seawall at golden hour, ferry to Granville Island for markets, then watch floatplanes skim the harbor. For a cheap skyline cruise, ride the SeaBus round-trip.</p>
    <p>Eat widely: sushi, dim sum, izakaya, Punjabi platters, and farm-to-table West Coast. Coffee: follow the line of cyclists — they always know.</p>
    <p>Rain plan: museum pairings (MOA + Nitobe Garden, or Science World + Olympic Village cafés). Bring a shell; leave the drama to the clouds.</p>

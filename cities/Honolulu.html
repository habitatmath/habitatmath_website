 <!-- HONOLULU -->
<h1>Honolulu – Trade winds, plate lunches, and perpetual summer</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  Honolulu anchors Oʻahu with <span class="metric">~350,000 residents</span> in the city and a metro over <span class="metric">1M</span>. 
  Waikīkī hums, Downtown deals, Kakaʻako paints murals, and Mānoa grows ferns the size of optimism. 
  AQI is usually a beachy <span class="metric">10–25</span>; occasional “vog” drifts in when winds flip.
</p>
<p>
  Sidewalk life is shorts + slippers + shave ice. The shoreline stretches for <span class="metric">~30 km</span> of beaches and parks. 
  Kamakana vibe meets global hub: you’ll hear Japanese, Tagalog, Korean, Pidgin, and aloha in one block.
</p>
<p>
  It’s laid-back but not lazy—military, tourism, and UH Mānoa keep the calendar full. 
  Sunset is a daily appointment; missing it feels impolite.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
  Warm all year: highs <span class="metric">27–31 °C</span>, lows <span class="metric">20–24 °C</span>. 
  Trade winds keep it kind. Annual sunshine around <span class="metric">3,000 h</span>. 
  Rainfall in town is modest—about <span class="metric">500–600 mm/yr</span>, with wetter valleys nearby.
</p>
<p>
  Hurricane season exists, panic season doesn’t. Showers are brief and theatrical. 
  Humidity <span class="metric">60–75%</span> most days; ocean temps <span class="metric">24–27 °C</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Sub-zero days: <span class="metric">0</span>. Snow? Only on Mauna Kea, a different island and a different attitude.
</p>

<h2>🚊 Public Transit Snapshot</h2>
<p>
  TheBus covers the island with <span class="metric">90+ routes</span>. Frequent lines hit every major corridor. 
  Adult monthly pass roughly <span class="metric">$80–90</span>. Reliability is solid if you plan buffers.
</p>
<p>
  Skyline (the new rail) runs its first segment east–west; expansions are staged. 
  Airport–city by bus takes <span class="metric">35–55 min</span>; rideshare <span class="metric">20–35 min</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Biking is growing—protected lanes downtown/Kakaʻako, plus the Biki share with <span class="metric">130+ stations</span>. 
  Walking near the coast is a joy, uphill neighborhoods less so.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Getting There & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>
  HNL is the hub of the Pacific, <span class="metric">~10 km</span> from Waikīkī. 
  Shuttles and buses are easy; taxis cost <span class="metric">$35–50</span> to the resort zone.
</p>
<p>
  Hotels swing by season: mid-range <span class="metric">$170–260/night</span>, luxe from <span class="metric">$350+</span>. 
  Condotel studios are common. Hostels hover around <span class="metric">$45–70</span> for dorm beds.
</p>
<p>
  Plate lunch <span class="metric">$11–15</span>, poke bowl <span class="metric">$13–18</span>, loco moco cures jet lag. 
  Coffee runs <span class="metric">$4–6</span>. Daily visitor budget without surf lessons: <span class="metric">$90–150</span>.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
  1-bed near town/Waikīkī: <span class="metric">$2,000–2,700/mo</span>; outside core <span class="metric">$1,600–2,100</span>. 
  Utilities with light A/C <span class="metric">$140–220/mo</span>. Internet <span class="metric">300–1,000 Mbps</span> at <span class="metric">$60–90</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Groceries for two: <span class="metric">$800–1,100/mo</span> (island tax, mainland prices). 
  Commutes vary <span class="metric">20–55 min</span>; H-1 at 5 pm is a personality test.
</p>
<p>
  QOL soars with beach proximity and park access. Noise falls after sunset; waves handle the lullaby.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Violent crime low; car break-ins happen at trailheads and beach lots—hide nothing. 
  EMS is responsive. Hospitals and clinics are plentiful for the population.
</p>
<p>
  Schools range widely; UH Mānoa and HPU anchor higher ed. 
  Newcomer admin is straightforward; the DMV line is a rite of passage.
</p>
<p>
  Tsunami signage is not decorative—know your zones. Hydration and reef-safe sunscreen are health policy.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  Bus to Diamond Head early, hike, then ocean dip. Sunset at Ala Moana Magic Island beats the crowd pricing of bars. 
  Swap crowded Hanauma days for quieter Sans Souci or Kaimana if you just want water therapy.
</p>
<p>
  Want views? Tantalus Drive at golden hour. Want noodles? Lines decide—go early or right before close. 
  Sunday farmers markets stock picnic kits better than delis.
</p>
<p>
  Respect kapu (closed areas) and ocean flags. If locals say “not today,” they mean “live to swim tomorrow.”
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Choose your triangle: home–work–ocean. If two are walkable, you win. 
  A dehumidifier saves wardrobes. Surf racks beat gyms for motivation.
</p>
<p>
  Cook local: kalo, greens, fresh fish when sales hit. Learn a few Hawaiian words—aloha is action, not just greeting.
</p>
<p>
  Build a rain plan: errands in morning, ma uka (mountain) trails after showers, beach on trades. 
  And yes, slippers are office-adjacent now—mostly.
</p>

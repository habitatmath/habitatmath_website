    <!-- MANILA -->
<h1>Manila – Organized chaos, karaoke volume, mango-level sweetness</h1>

<h2>First Look & City Pulse</h2>
<p>City proper packs <span class="metric">≈1.85M residents</span>; the Metro spills past <span class="metric">13M</span>. Skyscrapers, Spanish walls, neon markets—all within a few stops. Jeepneys are loud, painted, and strangely lovable. Malls are climate strategy and social hub rolled into one.</p>
<p>Air toggles between busy and freshly rinsed after rain: <span class="metric">AQI ~45–60</span>. Food stalls swarm every corner; lechon, halo-halo, and sisig do the convincing. English works widely; smiles are default settings.</p>
<p>Expect warmth—in weather and welcomes. Expect lines—in banks and brunch. And expect life to move, always, even when traffic refuses.</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>Hot most months: highs at <span class="metric">29–34 °C</span>. Dry season runs Dec–May with <span class="metric">250+ sunshine days</span>. Nights cool just enough for outdoor food courts.</p>
<p>Wet season Jun–Oct brings <span class="metric">~2,000 mm</span> of rain. Expect afternoon downpours that reset the day. Humidity sits <span class="metric">80–85%</span>; hydration is a hobby.</p>
<p>Typhoons visit Jul–Oct. Heat index spikes to <span class="metric">40 °C+</span> in Apr. UV is fierce; shade and hats are not fashion—they’re gear.</p>

<h2>🚇 Trains, Jeepneys & Everything Moving</h2>
<p>Three rail lines cover <span class="metric">50+ km</span> (LRT-1/2, MRT-3). Headways tighten in peak but crowding is real. Single fares range <span class="metric">₱13–₱28</span>; stored-value saves taps.</p>
<p>Jeepneys are the backbone with <span class="metric">50k+</span> units across Metro Manila. Base fare starts at <span class="metric">₱12</span>. Buses and UV Express vans plug longer gaps.</p>
<p>Pasig River ferries are the cheat code—uncrowded and scenic. Grab fills nights and rainy hours. Plan generous buffers; EDSA time bends physics.</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Arrivals & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>Mid-range hotels run <span class="metric">₱3,000–6,000/night</span>. Hostels <span class="metric">₱500–1,000</span>. Serviced condos abound in Makati, BGC, Ortigas.</p>
<p>NAIA is close but not quick: <span class="metric">~7–10 km</span> to business hubs, <span class="metric">25–60 min</span> by car. Airport taxis are regulated; Grab fares to Makati often <span class="metric">₱250–₱400</span>.</p>
<p>Eat gloriously on small coins. Street lunch <span class="metric">₱150–₱250</span>. Dinner for two mid-range <span class="metric">₱800–₱1,500</span>. Coffee <span class="metric">₱120–₱180</span>. Bottled water is wise.</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Central 1BR rent <span class="metric">₱25k–₱55k/mo</span> (Makati/BGC higher). Monthly groceries for two <span class="metric">₱10k–₱16k</span>. Utilities with A/C <span class="metric">₱3k–₱6k</span>.</p>
<p>Home internet <span class="metric">50–200 Mbps</span> for <span class="metric">₱1,200–₱2,000</span>. Mobile data is cheap and fast. Commutes average <span class="metric">45–75 min</span>; proximity beats square footage.</p>
<p>QOL is neighborhood-driven. Flood-prone zones matter—ask and map. Condos with generators and water tanks smooth brownouts and outages.</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>Safety varies by block. Petty theft clusters in crowds; keep phones close. Ride-share at night. Official taxis or app bookings only.</p>
<p>Private hospitals are excellent; HMOs recommended. ER waits fluctuate with storms. Pharmacies are everywhere and late.</p>
<p>Paperwork involves queues: visas, ACR card, TIN, bank. Many steps now hybrid-online. Patience, copies, and a pen solve 50% of issues.</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>Intramuros at golden hour, Binondo for eats, Manila Bay for sunsets. Join a food crawl—your taste buds will move in. Keep small bills for jeepneys and markets.</p>
<p>Use ferries and rail to dodge gridlock. Pack a light rain jacket even in “dry” months. Respect lines; ask staff for the right window.</p>
<p>Weekend mornings are best for parks and old-town walks. Don’t drink tap water. Learn “salamat” and “po”—your smile multiplier.</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>Pick life first, commute second: Makati, BGC, Ortigas, or a rail-adjacent pocket. Check flood maps before signing. Ask about backup power and water tanks.</p>
<p>Coworking runs <span class="metric">₱6k–₱12k/month</span>. Batch errands in malls for A/C and efficiency. Build a rainy-season playbook—apps, routes, indoor plans.</p>

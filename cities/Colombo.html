        <h1>Colombo ‚Äì Monsoon moods, tea-scented breezes, tuk-tuks on overdrive</h1>

        <h2>City Pulse</h2>
        <p>
          Colombo holds <span class="metric">~640k residents</span> in the city, but the metro spills over to 
          <span class="metric">5.6M+</span>. The skyline mixes colonial relics, glass towers, and palm-fringed shores. 
          The AQI averages <span class="metric">40‚Äì55</span>, which is tropical-fair unless you‚Äôre chasing mountain air. 
          Cricket isn‚Äôt just a sport‚Äîit‚Äôs urban oxygen. The Port of Colombo moves <span class="metric">7M+ TEUs</span> a year, 
          making it one of South Asia‚Äôs busiest. And Galle Face Green is the local lounge, where kites fly and street food 
          hawkers work in unison with sea breezes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pace is lively without being a complete sensory assault‚Äîunless you count the tuk-tuk drivers with an urgent 
          sense of adventure. Supermarkets, spice markets, and tea shops are all within a short walk or ride. The old Pettah 
          market sells everything from mangoes to phone chargers, sometimes in the same stall. Urban greenery dots the city, 
          though the real jungle lies inland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colombo‚Äôs charm is half saltwater, half cinnamon. It‚Äôs an entry point to Sri Lanka‚Äôs coastline, hill country, 
          and heritage cities‚Äîyet it keeps enough to keep you here for a while. And it‚Äôs not shy about making you sweat‚Äî
          humidity can hit <span class="metric">85%</span> in monsoon months.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>
          Equatorial heat meets tropical theatrics. Daily highs hover between <span class="metric">29‚Äì31¬∞C</span> year-round, 
          with lows rarely dipping below <span class="metric">24¬∞C</span>. Expect around <span class="metric">145 rainy days</span> 
          annually, split between the Southwest monsoon (May‚ÄìSep) and Northeast monsoon (Oct‚ÄìJan). Annual rainfall exceeds 
          <span class="metric">2,400 mm</span>. Sunshine days? Around <span class="metric">210+</span>, though cloud cover often 
          photobombs them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humidity averages <span class="metric">75‚Äì85%</span>, so sweat is a wardrobe constant. AQI stays generally safe 
          except for minor urban congestion spikes. UV index hovers in the ‚Äúseriously wear sunscreen‚Äù zone most of the year. 
          Sunrise dances between 5:50 and 6:10 am; sunset hangs around 6:20 pm‚Äîno seasonal surprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs the kind of climate where your coldest drink will sweat more than you do. Evening sea breezes offer some mercy 
          after hot afternoons, especially along Marine Drive.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Public Transit</h2>
        <p>
          Public buses dominate‚Äîcheap, loud, and numerous. Fares start at <span class="metric">LKR 40</span> for short hops. 
          Train lines radiate out to coastal and inland cities; scenic rides to Galle and Kandy are classics. Tuk-tuks swarm 
          every street, with average rides costing <span class="metric">LKR 200‚Äì600</span> depending on distance. Ride-hailing 
          apps like PickMe have tamed tuk-tuk bargaining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traffic congestion is common in peak hours‚Äîaverage city commute speed is <span class="metric">18 km/h</span>. 
          Cycling lanes are rare; pedestrians rely on reflexes. The new Colombo Light Rail project aims to add 
          <span class="metric">15.3 km</span> of clean transit by the late 2020s. Ferries are scenic but rare for regular commuting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can‚Äôt find a bus or tuk-tuk in Colombo, you‚Äôre either in a temple courtyard or sleepwalking.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Short-term Accommodation & Getting There</h2>
        <p>
          Bandaranaike International Airport sits <span class="metric">35 km</span> north, a <span class="metric">45‚Äì60 min</span> 
          drive in moderate traffic. Daily flights connect across Asia, Middle East, and Europe. Airport express bus runs to the 
          city for <span class="metric">LKR 150</span>. Taxis cost around <span class="metric">LKR 3,500</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guesthouses start at <span class="metric">LKR 3,000/night</span>. Decent mid-range hotels hover near 
          <span class="metric">LKR 10,000</span>. High-end stays like Galle Face Hotel command <span class="metric">LKR 25,000+</span> 
          but come with colonial charm and ocean views. Airbnb options are growing, often with rooftop terraces and breakfast 
          thrown in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Street food is cheap: <span class="metric">LKR 100</span> for a samosa, <span class="metric">LKR 300</span> for a rice packet. 
          Restaurants cover every budget‚Äîcurries for the budget backpacker, sushi for the expat banker.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Living Costs, Amenities & Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          Monthly rent for a 1-bed apartment in the city center averages <span class="metric">LKR 120,000</span>. Internet is 
          <span class="metric">LKR 3,500/month</span> for 100 Mbps. Utilities add another <span class="metric">LKR 15,000</span>. 
          Mobile coverage is solid; power cuts happen but are usually short.
        </p>
        <p>
          Markets offer cheap fresh produce: bananas <span class="metric">LKR 200/kg</span>, chicken <span class="metric">LKR 900/kg</span>. 
          Imported cheese and wine can break your budget. Healthcare is affordable, with private hospitals offering short wait times. 
          Expats often use Lanka Hospitals or Asiri Medical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colombo scores high on amenities for its size‚Äîshopping malls, gyms, cinemas, and co-working spaces are easy to find. 
          Public parks and the beach keep it breathable.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Safety, Health, Education & Bureaucracy</h2>
        <p>
          Safety index is moderate; petty theft in crowded markets is your main concern. Violent crime is low. Emergency response is 
          improving‚Äîambulances average <span class="metric">10‚Äì15 min</span> in central zones. Tap water is not drinkable; bottled 
          water costs <span class="metric">LKR 60/liter</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          International schools are available, tuition averaging <span class="metric">LKR 1.5‚Äì2.5M/year</span>. University of Colombo 
          offers good higher education options. Bureaucracy can be slow; expect multiple visits for residency or permits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthcare is inexpensive: a GP visit costs <span class="metric">LKR 2,000‚Äì3,000</span>. Pharmacies are widespread. Air 
          ambulance evacuation insurance is recommended for rural travel.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Tips for Tourists</h2>
        <p>
          Carry small notes for tuk-tuks. Galle Face Green is best at sunset. Visit markets in the morning for fresh seafood. Wear 
          breathable fabrics; you‚Äôll thank yourself. Stay in areas like Kollupitiya or Bambalapitiya for central access without overpaying.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Tips for Long-term Dwellers</h2>
        <p>
          Invest in a dehumidifier during monsoon months. Learn basic Sinhala greetings‚Äîit buys goodwill instantly. Join local expat forums 
          for rental leads. Explore suburbs like Nugegoda for cheaper housing and local flavor. Don‚Äôt underestimate Colombo‚Äôs caf√© 
          culture‚Äîit‚Äôs where networking often happens.

    <h1>River, Rinks & Red Maple: Ottawa’s Quiet Capital Energy</h1>
    <p>Ottawa, Canada’s capital on the Ottawa River, blends government calm with outdoorsy ease. About <span class="metric">1.0–1.1 million</span> people live in the city, with a metro around <span class="metric">1.4–1.6 million</span>. Neighborhoods range from parliament-side promenades to leafy streets and market lanes where you can grab a beaver tail and still make your meeting.</p>
    <p>The famous Rideau Canal turns into a winter skateway up to <span class="metric">7.8 km</span> when conditions allow, while summer brings bikes and kayaks back to the water. Summers hover near <span class="metric">24–27°C</span>; winters lean bold at <span class="metric">-10–-3°C</span> with proper snow. Green space is generous — river paths, the Greenbelt, and parklands for easy weekend resets.</p>
    <p>Cafés, museums, and bilingual charm (English/French) shape daily life. Festivals punctuate the year — Winterlude’s ice sculptures and the Canadian Tulip Festival’s <span class="metric">1M+</span> blooms make shoulder seasons sparkle.</p>

    <h2>Moving Around Without Missing a Beat</h2>
    <p>OC Transpo’s O-Train (Line <span class="metric">1</span>) and a dense bus grid cover the city. Peak headways on the LRT often run <span class="metric">3–5</span> minutes; core bus corridors fill the gaps. Single fares land about <span class="metric">CAD $3.5–$4.0</span> with contactless taps; a day pass is roughly <span class="metric">CAD $11–$13</span>.</p>
    <p>Cycling is strong: multi-use pathways and bike lanes add up to <span class="metric">600+ km</span>, including scenic runs along the Canal and river. Commute times average around <span class="metric">25–30</span> minutes, shorter if you live near the transit spine.</p>
    <p>Ottawa International Airport (YOW) sits ~<span class="metric">10 km</span> from downtown; typical rides take <span class="metric">15–25</span> minutes depending on traffic. Intercity trains from Ottawa Station reach Montréal in ~<span class="metric">2</span> hours and Toronto in ~<span class="metric">4–4.5</span> hours.</p>

    <h2>Seasons in the Sun (and Snow)</h2>
    <p>Summer brings patio weather at <span class="metric">24–27°C</span> and long evenings on the Canal. Autumn cools to <span class="metric">8–15°C</span> with fiery maples everywhere. Winter settles near <span class="metric">-10–-3°C</span>, with cold snaps beyond that — perfect for skating and hot chocolate diplomacy.</p>
    <p>Expect annual precipitation around <span class="metric">900–1,000 mm</span>, with snow totals commonly <span class="metric">150–250 cm</span>. Spring pops fast, and tulips take their victory lap in May.</p>
    <p>Wind-chill is real; dress in smart layers. In summer, pack a light rain shell for surprise showers.</p>

    <h2>Landing Soft: Travel & Short Stays</h2>
    <p>Downtown hotels cluster near Parliament, ByWard Market, and the Canal. Mid-range stays often run <span class="metric">CAD $160–$260</span>/night; short-let studios commonly <span class="metric">CAD $110–$200</span>. Wi-Fi speeds of <span class="metric">100–500 Mbps</span> are typical in modern buildings.</p>
    <p>First-timers: base near ByWard Market for walkability and food, or the Golden Triangle/Elgin Street for cafés and canal strolls. Parking eases up outside the core; transit and bikes work well inside it.</p>
    <p>Airport arrivals are straightforward via rideshare, taxi, or bus links; luggage-friendly vehicles are common on peak flight banks.</p>

    <h2>Homes, Health & Paperwork</h2>
    <p>One-bedroom rents: downtown <span class="metric">CAD $1,800–$2,300</span>/month; outside core <span class="metric">CAD $1,500–$1,900</span>. Utilities for a 1-bed: <span class="metric">CAD $120–$180</span>. Groceries for one: <span class="metric">CAD $300–$450</span>/month with home cooking.</p>
    <p>Healthcare runs via Ontario’s system with strong clinic coverage; urgent-care centers trim ER waits. Most city services, permits, and payments have clear online pathways.</p>
    <p>Universities (uOttawa, Carleton) and federal institutions add research mass, steady jobs, and a lively student presence.</p>

    <h2>Safe Streets & Social Scenes</h2>
    <p>Ottawa feels orderly and well-lit in central districts; as in any city, usual night-out awareness applies. Transit staffing is visible, and stations are monitored.</p>
    <p>Social life spans galleries, national museums, indie venues, and a food scene that’s quietly ambitious — from shawarma halls to farm-to-fork bistros.</p>
    <p>Green escapes are minutes away: Gatineau Park’s trails (across the river) turn into cross-country ski corridors in winter and hiking paths the rest of the year.</p>

    <h2>Extra Pointers for Visitors</h2>
    <p>Skate the Rideau Canal when it opens; in summer, paddle it instead. Sunset on Major’s Hill Park sets Parliament in postcard light.</p>
    <p>For a budget “river cruise,” walk the Portage and Alexandra bridges loop — skyline, locks, museums, repeat. Coffee stops: Elgin, Hintonburg, and Wellington West.</p>
    <p>Souvenirs: maple treats, local roasters, and minimalist Parliament prints — easy to pack, easy to gift.</p>

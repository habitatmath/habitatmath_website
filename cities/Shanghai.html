 <!-- SHANGHAI -->
<h1>Shanghai – Neon on the Bund, noodles at dawn, velocity everywhere</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  China’s biggest metropolis hums with <span class="metric">~25M residents</span>. 
  The Bund’s historic facades stare at Pudong’s space-age skyline across the Huangpu—old money meets future tense.
</p>
<p>
  AQI is often <span class="metric">35–70</span> with ocean breezes helping on clear days. 
  Neighborhoods flip moods fast: French Concession plane trees, Lujiazui towers, lane-house cafés, late-night baozi.
</p>
<p>
  It’s cosmopolitan, caffeinated, and very walkable in pockets. If your hobby is “new,” you’re in luck.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
  Humid subtropical. Winters are cool and damp: highs <span class="metric">7–11 °C</span>, 
  sub-zero mornings on <span class="metric">5–10 days/yr</span>. Snow is rare but social-media famous.
</p>
<p>
  Summers are warm and glossy: highs <span class="metric">30–35 °C</span>, heat index higher. 
  Annual rain <span class="metric">1,100–1,300 mm</span>, with plum rain season in early summer and occasional typhoon brushes.
</p>
<p>
  Sunshine totals <span class="metric">1,900–2,100 h/yr</span>. Best months: March–May and October–November.
</p>

<h2>🚇 Public Transit Snapshot</h2>
<p>
  The metro is a marvel: <span class="metric">20+ lines</span>, <span class="metric">800+ km</span>, 
  <span class="metric">500+ stations</span>. Peak headways hit <span class="metric">2–3 min</span>. 
  Tap-in with transit cards or mobile pay; signage is bilingual.
</p>
<p>
  Buses are dense; ferries cross the Huangpu; maglev sprints <span class="metric">~30 km</span> to PVG in <span class="metric">~8 min</span> at top speed. 
  Hongqiao hub stitches HSR to half of eastern China.
</p>
<p>
  Bike-share saturation is real—unlock and go. Late service runs deep on core lines.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Getting There & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>
  Two airports: PVG (Pudong) for long-haul, SHA (Hongqiao) for domestic/regional. 
  PVG–Lujiazui by maglev + metro in <span class="metric">~25–30 min</span>; taxi <span class="metric">45–70 min</span> traffic depending.
</p>
<p>
  Hotels: business mid-range <span class="metric">¥550–950/night</span>, luxury skyline views from <span class="metric">¥1,600+</span>. 
  Boutique lane-house stays are mood + location.
</p>
<p>
  Daily eats: shengjian/baozi breakfast <span class="metric">¥6–15</span>, noodles <span class="metric">¥25–45</span>, 
  dinner for two mid-range <span class="metric">¥180–350</span>. Third-wave coffee <span class="metric">¥28–45</span>.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
  Central 1-bed <span class="metric">¥8,000–13,000/mo</span>; outer rings <span class="metric">¥5,000–8,000</span>. 
  Utilities with summer A/C <span class="metric">¥400–800/mo</span>. Internet <span class="metric">¥120–200/mo</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Groceries for two <span class="metric">¥2,000–3,200/mo</span>. Commutes average <span class="metric">35–55 min</span>. 
  Green belts and river walks soften the glass-and-steel energy.
</p>
<p>
  Cashless is king; courier delivery is lightning. QOL is highest when your lane-house and metro stop are best friends.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Low violent crime; crowds attract pickpockets—standard vigilance. Hospitals and international clinics are numerous; direct billing eases visits.
</p>
<p>
  International schools cluster in Puxi/Pudong. Emergency response is efficient in central districts.
</p>
<p>
  Residence registration is mandatory within days; leases need the right chops—landlord experience matters.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  Time the Bund at blue hour; then cross to a sky bar for the reverse view. 
  Walk the French Concession for plane-tree shade and cafés; eat soup dumplings that challenge physics.
</p>
<p>
  Ride the ferry once—cheap skyline cinema. Seek lane-house eateries off Nanjing Rd; malls hide excellent food halls.
</p>
<p>
  Rain plan: museums (Power Station of Art, Long), bookstores, and hotpot. Typhoon alerts? Enjoy indoor tea culture.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Live by your line and your lifestyle triangle (home–work–market). Test cell signal in your building; some basements are Faraday jokes.
</p>
<p>
  Learn address lingo for deliveries; pin-drop etiquette is a weekly sport. Keep a dehumidifier for July–August.
</p>
<p>
  Weekend HSR runs redefine “nearby”: Hangzhou for lakes, Suzhou for gardens, Ningbo for seafood. Your calendar will fill itself.

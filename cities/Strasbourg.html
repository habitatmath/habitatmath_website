<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
Don’t just stop at the cathedral — climb it. The view is worth the <span class="metric">332 steps</span>. Skip taxis; trams and bikes are faster and far cheaper.

</p>
<p>
Photography tip — go early to Petite France for empty streets and golden light. Most museums are free on the first Sunday of the month. Don’t miss Parc de l’Orangerie if you want to spot the city’s resident storks. Carry a rain jacket; there are <span class="metric">160</span> rainy days per year. Strasbourg’s old town is compact — you can walk the whole UNESCO zone in under <span class="metric">40 minutes</span>.
</p>
<p>
Language hack: locals appreciate a “Guten Tag” almost as much as a “Bonjour.” Watch out for cobblestones — heels and thin bicycle tires don’t mix well. And yes, the canals are as photogenic as they look on postcards.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
Get a bike. With <span class="metric">560 km</span> of cycle paths, it’s the fastest commute. Learn some German in addition to French; it’s surprisingly handy. Rent prices drop by <span class="metric">15–20%</span> just outside the city center. If you’re a remote worker, look into coworking spaces — monthly passes start around <span class="metric">€150</span>.
</p>
<p>
Grocery markets like Marché de Neudorf offer fresh produce at <span class="metric">20%</span> less than supermarkets. Energy bills can spike in winter, so budget an extra <span class="metric">€40–50</span> monthly from November to March. Public transport monthly passes save you up to <span class="metric">€200</span> yearly compared to buying single tickets.
</p>
<p>
Healthcare is high-quality but register with a GP early; popular doctors fill up fast. Integrate into local clubs or sports groups — it’s the quickest way to build a network. Keep rain gear handy year-round; you’ll thank yourself later.

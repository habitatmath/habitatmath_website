    <h1>River Grandeur: Moscow’s Marble Metro & Snowlight</h1>
    <p>Moscow blends imperial avenues with glassy new districts along the Moskva River. Home to roughly <span class="metric">≈ 13 million</span> people, the city runs on an ultra-frequent metro that glides beneath palaces, theaters, and pocket parks. You’ll feel the scale in its ring roads and the intimacy in its courtyards — birch trees, playgrounds, and neighborhood bakeries tucked between grand façades.</p>
    <p>Transit is the heartbeat: the metro spans <span class="metric">400+ km</span> when you include ring and connector lines, moving well over <span class="metric">1.5–2.5 billion</span> rides a year in normal times. Winters lean serious at <span class="metric">-10–-3°C</span>, summers settle at <span class="metric">22–26°C</span>, and shoulder seasons are crisp and photogenic. Green space tops <span class="metric">30%</span> by many counts, with wide riverside promenades and forests at the edge of town.</p>
    <p>Everyday life is practical: neighborhood groceries, late-opening pharmacies, and plentiful kiosks. Digital payments are ubiquitous, and city services increasingly streamlined. Coffee culture thrives, and museum density keeps weekends busy.</p>

    <h2>Moving Around Without Missing a Beat</h2>
    <p>The metro and MCC/MCD rail lines interlace for rapid cross-city trips; peak headways are often <span class="metric">1–3</span> minutes on trunk sections. Contactless taps and phone wallets breeze through gates. A single ride is inexpensive by European standards, with daily and monthly caps making commuting predictable.</p>
    <p>Cycling grows each year, with seasonal bike-share docks across central districts. Surface trams and trolleybuses add coverage, while express buses link outer hubs. The three major airports — <span class="metric">SVO</span>, <span class="metric">DME</span>, <span class="metric">VKO</span> — connect via rail links and highways; typical center travel times are <span class="metric">35–60</span> minutes outside rush hour.</p>
    <p>Intercity trains run reliably from multiple terminals: St. Petersburg in ~<span class="metric">4</span> hours on the fast line, and a web of sleepers radiating further afield.</p>

    <h2>Seasons in the Snow Glow</h2>
    <p>Winter paints the city in silver-blue light. Expect daytime around <span class="metric">-6–-2°C</span> with regular snow; layers and good boots earn MVP status. Spring arrives in a rush — parks thaw, cafés spill onto sidewalks, and highs hit <span class="metric">10–18°C</span>.</p>
    <p>Summer feels pleasantly warm at <span class="metric">22–26°C</span> with long daylight and evening strolls along the river. Autumn turns the boulevards copper at <span class="metric">8–15°C</span>. Annual precipitation falls near the middle of the European range, with frequent light snow rather than blizzards.</p>
    <p>Air quality varies by corridor and wind, but winter inversions are a known pattern; green belts help ease it on breezier days.</p>

    <h2>Landing Soft: Travel & Short Stays</h2>
    <p>Airport rail links drop you centrally in <span class="metric">35–45</span> minutes. Long-distance coaches and trains cover the region at regular intervals. For first-time arrivals, the metro’s bilingual signage and line colors make navigation easier than it looks.</p>
    <p>Short stays range widely: hostels from <span class="metric">₽1,000–₽2,000</span> per night, business hotels at <span class="metric">₽7,000–₽15,000</span>, upscale options higher. Central studios on short-let platforms can land around <span class="metric">₽5,000–₽10,000</span> a night, with Wi-Fi commonly <span class="metric">100–300 Mbps</span>.</p>
    <p>Work-friendly cafés cluster in Tverskoy, Zamoskvorechye, and Basmanny; power outlets are common, and pastries are dangerously good.</p>

    <h2>Homes, Health & Paperwork</h2>
    <p>One-bedroom rents in the core often sit around <span class="metric">₽70k–₽120k</span>/month; outside center <span class="metric">₽45k–₽80k</span>. Utilities for a 1-bed average <span class="metric">₽5k–₽10k</span>; monthly groceries for one can be kept near <span class="metric">₽15k–₽25k</span> with home cooking.</p>
    <p>Healthcare access is broad with a mix of public and private clinics; private centers shorten queues and add English-speaking staff. Many admin tasks — bills,

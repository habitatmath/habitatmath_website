<h1>Beijing – Imperial walls, modern malls, and big-sky ambition</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  China’s capital runs on scale and ceremony. City proper houses <span class="metric">~22M residents</span>; the metro region stretches far beyond. 
  Axial avenues meet hutong alleys; courtyards sit behind red doors, ring roads loop like orbits.
</p>
<p>
  AQI swings with seasons—blue-sky streaks are common now, yet winter inversions can nudge <span class="metric">AQI 80–150</span>. 
  Parks are plentiful: Temple of Heaven dawn tai chi, Beihai boats by afternoon. 
  Museums, tech zones, and a restaurant scene that spans every province.
</p>
<p>
  It’s orderly, fast, and surprisingly green in pockets. If you like structure with side quests, this capital delivers.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
  Continental flair. Winters are crisp: highs <span class="metric">−3–5 °C</span>, sub-zero mornings on <span class="metric">60–80 days/yr</span>. 
  Snow is light but photogenic—<span class="metric">5–10 days/yr</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Summers go warm-to-hot: highs <span class="metric">29–34 °C</span>, short heatwaves above <span class="metric">35 °C</span>. 
  Annual precipitation around <span class="metric">600 mm</span>, concentrated in July–August storms.
</p>
<p>
  Sunshine is generous at <span class="metric">2,500–2,800 h/yr</span>. Spring can be dusty; autumn is perfection—golden ginkgos, blue skies, light sweaters.
</p>

<h2>🚇 Public Transit Snapshot</h2>
<p>
  One of the world’s largest metros: <span class="metric">25+ lines</span>, <span class="metric">700+ km</span>, 
  <span class="metric">400+ stations</span>. Peak headways <span class="metric">2–3 min</span>. 
  Tap with a transit card or mobile pay.
</p>
<p>
  Buses blanket the gaps; BRT runs key corridors. Daxing Intl to the city via the Airport Express in 
  <span class="metric">19–30 min</span> depending on destination. Taxis are metered and plentiful.
</p>
<p>
  Cycling is back in style—shared bikes on most corners. Commuter punctuality is a point of pride.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Getting There & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>
  Two main airports: PEK (Capital) and PKX (Daxing). High-speed rails fan to Tianjin (<span class="metric">30–40 min</span>), Shanghai (<span class="metric">4.5–5.5 h</span>).
</p>
<p>
  Hotels span ranges: business mid-range <span class="metric">¥500–900/night</span>, luxury 
  <span class="metric">¥1,500+</span>. Courtyard boutiques in hutongs are mood-forward.
</p>
<p>
  Daily eats scale fast: breakfast jianbing <span class="metric">¥8–15</span>, noodles <span class="metric">¥25–45</span>, 
  Peking duck dinner for two <span class="metric">¥200–400</span>. Coffee <span class="metric">¥20–35</span>.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
  Central 1-bed <span class="metric">¥7,000–12,000/mo</span>; outer districts <span class="metric">¥4,500–7,000</span>. 
  Utilities (seasonal heat/AC) <span class="metric">¥400–800/mo</span>. Home internet <span class="metric">¥120–200/mo</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Groceries for two <span class="metric">¥1,800–2,800/mo</span>. Commutes average <span class="metric">35–60 min</span> across rings. 
  Parks and lakes punctuate density; sidewalks invite evening walks.
</p>
<p>
  Digital payments everywhere; delivery logistics are wizard-level. QOL jumps if you live near a metro + park combo.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Very low violent crime; petty theft uncommon but stay aware in crowds. Hospitals are abundant; international clinics shorten wait times.
</p>
<p>
  Schools range from local key schools to international campuses. Health insurance with direct-billing clinics is worth it.
</p>
<p>
  Residence permits and registrations are process-heavy—appointments, photos, copies. Once set, life runs smoothly.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  The Great Wall: arrive early, pick a section (Mutianyu for views, Jinshanling for hikes). 
  Forbidden City tickets sell out—book ahead. Ride Line 2 for a DIY ring-city sampler.
</p>
<p>
  Slurp zhajiangmian in a hutong, then tea-house hop near Shichahai. 
  Badge and scan culture is normal—carry ID and power bank.
</p>
<p>
  Autumn is peak. Winter has palace vibes with fewer elbows; wear real layers.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Live by your line, not your map—two transfers beat a long bus. Learn a few Mandarin phrases; service life accelerates.
</p>
<p>
  Air days vary—keep a small purifier and check forecasts. Embrace delivery for bulky items; use lockers for packages.
</p>
<p>
  Weekend trains unlock Hebei hikes and hot springs. Save your favorite noodle shop in maps; it will vanish behind a new facade and reappear two doors down.

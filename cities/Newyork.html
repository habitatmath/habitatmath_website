    <h1>The City That Moves: New York’s Skyline, Subways & Slices</h1>
    <p>New York City is home to about <span class="metric">8.5 million</span> residents across five boroughs and a metro of <span class="metric">~20 million</span>. Skyscrapers crowd the Hudson and East River edges, but pocket parks, stoops, and bodega corners make the daily rhythm. It’s fast, funny, and relentlessly inventive — a place where you can cross three cultures in a single block.</p>
    <p>The subway’s <span class="metric">24/7</span> heartbeat ties it together: <span class="metric">470+</span> stations, multiple trunk lines, and annual rides in the <span class="metric">1.5–2.0 billion</span> range in normal years. Summers can run <span class="metric">27–31°C</span> and humid; winters average <span class="metric">0–5°C</span> with a few snow days. Spring and fall are unanimously beloved.</p>
    <p>Work and play blur easily: galleries, Broadway, indie theaters, street festivals, and a food scene that ranges from dollar slices to Michelin dining. Wi-Fi is everywhere, and cafés are laptop-friendly (with side-eye if you hog a four-top — loveable NYC honesty).</p>

    <h2>Moving Around Without Missing a Beat</h2>
    <p>The MTA web spans subway, buses, and regional rails (LIRR, Metro-North). Tap-to-pay OMNY makes fares simple: a single ride is <span class="metric">$2.90</span>, and the <span class="metric">7-day</span> unlimited is <span class="metric">$34</span>. Typical trunk headways are <span class="metric">2–5</span> minutes at peak; late nights stretch longer but keep rolling.</p>
    <p>Airports are a trio: <span class="metric">JFK</span>, <span class="metric">LGA</span>, <span class="metric">EWR</span>. The AirTrain + LIRR/subway combo reaches Manhattan from JFK in ~<span class="metric">35–50</span> minutes; upgraded bus links speed LGA trips; New Jersey Transit connects EWR in ~<span class="metric">30–45</span> minutes.</p>
    <p>Bike lanes expand annually, with protected routes on key avenues and bridges; Citi Bike stations are dense in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and parts of Queens. Ferries stitch waterfront neighborhoods with skyline views.</p>

    <h2>Seasons in the City Light</h2>
    <p>Summer: warm-to-hot at <span class="metric">27–31°C</span>, pop-up thunderstorms, endless rooftop sunsets. Autumn brings <span class="metric">12–20°C</span> and Central Park foliage. Winter runs <span class="metric">0–5°C</span> on average with occasional snow; sturdy boots and layers pay off on slushy days.</p>
    <p>Annual precipitation is roughly <span class="metric">1,100–1,300 mm</span>, well-distributed — expect rain in any month. Spring is mild at <span class="metric">12–22°C</span> and arguably peak walking season.</p>
    <p>Breezes can funnel through avenues; a light windbreaker is a year-round friend.</p>

    <h2>Landing Soft: Travel & Short Stays</h2>
    <p>Hotels range widely: good mid-range often lands around <span class="metric">$180–$320</span>/night in Manhattan; outer-borough gems can be less. Short-let studios fluctuate with season, commonly <span class="metric">$140–$250</span> per night; Wi-Fi speeds of <span class="metric">200–500 Mbps</span> are common in modern buildings.</p>
    <p>Neighborhoods for easy first visits: Midtown (hyper-central), the Village (walkable charm), Williamsburg/Greenpoint (cafés + skyline views), Long Island City (quick trains + space).</p>
    <p>Transit from airports is easiest if you land with a contactless card ready; cabs are flat-fare to/from JFK-Manhattan, and rideshare waits vary by terminal.</p>

    <h2>Homes, Health & Paperwork</h2>
    <p>City-center one-bed rents typically run <span class="metric">$3,200–$4,200</span>/month; outer-borough equivalents <span class="metric">$2,200–$3,000</span>. Utilities for a 1-bed often total <span class="metric">$120–$200</span>/month; monthly groceries for one commonly <span class="metric">$350–$550</span> with mixed dining out.</p>
    <p>Healthcare is world-class but insurance-driven; urgent care clinics reduce ER wait pain, and telehealth is widely available. Most admin tasks — rent payments, utilities, transit, even laundries — have app workflows.</p>
    <p>Universities and colleges (CUNY, Columbia, NYU, more) add a huge student footprint and research ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Safe Streets & Social Scenes</h2>
    <p>Street safety varies by corridor and hour; main avenues are well-lit with plenty of foot traffic. Transit has visible staffing, cameras, and late-night riders by the dozens. As ever, city smarts help: keep your bag zipped and your vibes confident.</p>
    <p>Social life overflows — stand-up basements, gallery nights, food halls, block parties, and impromptu buskers who should frankly be on Broadway already.</p>
    <p>Parks are the city’s lungs: Central Park, Prospect Park, the Hudson River Greenway, and Governors Island cycle paths on summer weekends.</p>

    <h2>Extra Pointers for Visitors</h2>
    <p>Walk the Manhattan Bridge one way (better skyline views than the Brooklyn Bridge), then loop DUMBO for cobblestones and coffee. For a $<span class="metric">2.90</span> harbor ride, take the Staten Island Ferry and back.</p>
    <p>Eat across boroughs: Queens for global kitchens, the Bronx for Arthur Ave Italian, Staten Island for Sri Lankan spots, and Brooklyn for bagels that inspire poetry.</p>
    <p>Rain plan: museums cluster smartly — pick a pair near each other (e.g., the Met + Neue Galerie) and thread them with a park-side café.</p>

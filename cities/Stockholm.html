        <h1>Stockholm – Where Islands Wear a Crown of Light</h1>

        <h2>City at a Glance</h2>
        <p>Stockholm spans <span class="metric">14 islands</span>, stitched together by <span class="metric">57 bridges</span>, offering the magic of water at every turn. The population stands around <span class="metric">975,000</span> in the city proper, with over <span class="metric">2.4 million</span> in the metro. AQI levels often hover under <span class="metric">20</span>, making the air feel as fresh as its winter mornings. The city runs on nearly <span class="metric">90% renewable energy</span> for heating, giving it eco-superstar status. Bike lanes stretch for over <span class="metric">800 km</span>, while trams and ferries knit the urban fabric together. The historic Gamla Stan pulls in millions annually, yet life here rarely feels rushed. Digital services, from e-IDs to seamless cashless payments, make daily life glide. Waterfront cafés double as co-working spots, a nod to Stockholm's balance of leisure and productivity.</p>
        
        <p>It’s a city that blends Nordic minimalism with royal grandeur. From the Royal Palace’s <span class="metric">600 rooms</span> to the world’s first open-air museum, Skansen, Stockholm’s history is worn with pride. Residents love the outdoors—<span class="metric">30% of the city</span> is green space. Summers gift <span class="metric">18 hours</span> of daylight, winters keep people huddled in cozy interiors, yet never bored. The Swedish work-life balance is an art form, with generous parental leave and cultural perks at every corner.</p>
        
        <p>Public benches often have blankets in winter, ferries are part of the commuter network, and drinking water is so pure it’s bottled straight from taps. That’s Stockholm’s signature: comfort and charm, delivered without noise.</p>
        
        <h2>Getting Around with Grace</h2>
        <p>SL, Stockholm’s transit authority, runs a unified system covering buses, trams, ferries, and metro, all with a single pass.

The commuter train network stretches over <span class="metric">200 km</span>, reaching suburbs and nearby towns.</p>
        
        <p>Bike-sharing stations dot nearly every district, and the city’s electric bus fleet keeps growing, reducing emissions. Travel times are predictable: 10 minutes from Södermalm to the city center, 20 minutes from central to the airport express. Fare systems are contactless, and almost no one buys paper tickets anymore.</p>
        
        <p>In winter, ferries keep running through thin ice, and the metro’s deep tunnels shield riders from sub-zero winds. Stockholm proves that efficiency and beauty can commute together.</p>
        
        <h2>Seasons of Light and Ice</h2>

Summer boasts <span class="metric">18–19 hours</span> of daylight, while December offers just <span class="metric">6 hours</span>—perfect for candle-lit cafés.</p>
        
        <p>Rain is spread evenly, about <span class="metric">530 mm annually</span>, rarely disruptive. Sunshine days with 6+ hours total <span class="metric">160 annually</span>. Spring arrives late but blooms fast, covering parks like Kungsträdgården in pink cherry blossoms.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn is crisp, with <span class="metric">10°C</span> days and golden trees reflecting in waterways. The city is known for its lack of extreme heat—heatwaves are rare, peaking at <span class="metric">28°C</span> occasionally. Winter winds can hit <span class="metric">25 km/h</span>, but the stillness after snowfall is worth braving the chill.</p>
        
        <p>The real magic? The shifting golden light that paints every season differently, making even daily commutes an art piece.</p>
        
        <h2>Arrivals, Stays, and Daily Tastes</h2>

        <p>Stockholm scores high on QOL indexes, ranking in the global top 20 consistently. Bureaucracy is digital-friendly, from tax filing to permit applications.</p>
        
        <h2>Safe Shores and Social Currents</h2>

        <h2>Traveler’s Notes</h2>
        <p>Buy a <span class="metric">72-hour SL pass</span>—it covers ferries, buses, and trams. Explore the metro art, especially Stadion and Kungsträdgården stations. Visit the archipelago in summer for endless island hopping.</p>
        
        <p>In winter, try ice swimming followed by sauna—locals swear by it. Avoid taxis; public transit is faster and cheaper. Keep a fika habit—coffee breaks are sacred.</p>
        
        <p>Stockholm is best enjoyed at walking pace, where details—like cobblestones and waterfront reflections—steal the show.</p>
        
        <h2>For the Long Haul</h2>
        <p>Long-term dwellers benefit from Sweden’s social safety nets, parental leave, and generous vacation days. Housing queues can be long—join early if you plan to stay. Networking through meet-ups helps integrate faster.</p>
        
        <p>Seasonal adjustment is key: embrace winter sports and summer’s long days. Learn basic Swedish; it earns goodwill instantly. Tap into public libraries and free events for cultural immersion.</p>
        
        <p>Stockholm’s balance of nature, tech, and tradition makes it an easy city to grow roots in—if you’re ready to love it through every shade of light.</p>

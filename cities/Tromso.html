 <!-- TROMSØ -->
<h1>❄️ Tromsø – Midnight sun, polar night, northern lights</h1>
<p>
Arctic circle city with big-town culture. Mountains, islands, bridges, repeat. Cafés glow in winter; trails explode in summer. University energy keeps it youthful.
</p>
<p>
The waterfront is all drama—ships, snow, and sudden light. Compact centre; steep bits beyond. You come for nature and stay for the vibe.
</p>
<p>
Air is pristine: <span class="metric">AQI 5–15</span>. Costs are high; experiences are higher. The calendar is split by the sky: endless day, then deep blue twilight.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
Winters are cold, snowy, and magical. <span class="metric">Sub-zero days ≈ 120–160/yr</span>. <span class="metric">Snowfall days ≈ 70–100/yr</span>. January runs around <span class="metric">−4 °C</span> by the sea; colder inland.
</p>
<p>
Midnight sun from late May to late July. Polar night from late November to mid-January. Sunshine hours are low on paper, but summer daylight is continuous. <span class="metric">Rainy/sleet days ≈ 150–170/yr</span>.
</p>
<p>
Winds funnel through sounds and valleys; gusts happen. Aurora season peaks Sep–Mar; clear, cold nights reward patience. Ice grips sidewalks—spikes help.
</p>

<h2>🚍 Public Transport</h2>
<p>
Buses do most of the lifting. Core headways <span class="metric">7–10 min</span> on main lines; off-peak <span class="metric">15–30 min</span>. Night coverage exists but thins late.
</p>
<p>
Monthly pass costs about <span class="metric">NOK 700–900</span>. Contactless and apps work everywhere. Real-time boards at main stops.
</p>
<p>
Airport is <span class="metric">~5 km</span> from centre; bus <span class="metric">10–15 min</span>. Ferries and express boats link islands and fjords. Roads are good; winter tires are life.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays & Daily Costs</h2>
<p>
Hotels: <span class="metric">NOK 1,200–2,200/night</span> depending on season. Hostels from <span class="metric">NOK 400–600</span>. Aurora months raise prices fast.
</p>
<p>
Meals: casual lunch <span class="metric">NOK 160–220</span>. Dinner for two mid-range <span class="metric">NOK 600–900</span>. Coffee <span class="metric">NOK 40–55</span>.
</p>
<p>
Airport bus <span class="metric">NOK 50–120</span> depending on ticket. Tours are pricey—budget for at least one aurora chase. Museum entries <span class="metric">NOK 120–180</span>.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
Central 1BR rents <span class="metric">NOK 12,000–18,000</span>. Groceries for two <span class="metric">NOK 4,500–6,500</span>/month. Utilities <span class="metric">NOK 1,200–1,900</span>.
</p>
<p>
Internet <span class="metric">100–250 Mbps</span> for <span class="metric">NOK 500–700</span>. Commutes <span class="metric">15–25 min</span>. District heating/electric mix; bills spike in cold snaps.
</p>
<p>
Hospitals and clinics are solid for the size. Footpaths are salted and sanded; still slippery. Nature access is five minutes in any direction.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>
Safety index is very high; crime is low. Biggest risks: weather and hiking errors. EMS is quick in the core.
</p>
<p>
University town with strong English proficiency. Services are digital; IDs and permits handled online. Processing <span class="metric">2–4 weeks</span> typical.
</p>
<p>
Public buildings are accessible; terrain outside the centre is not. Winter rules—shoes with grip and a headlamp are essentials.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
Book aurora tours early in peak months. Bring hand warmers and spikes. Ride the Fjellheisen cable car for views if skies clear. Midnight sun hikes are surreal—sleep schedule optional.
</p>
<p>
Use the day pass if you’ll hop buses. Dress in layers; wind steals heat. Respect sea weather; boat tours can cancel last-minute.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
South- or west-facing flats feel brighter in winter. Build a light routine: lamps, gym, sauna. Join local outdoor groups; safety in numbers.
</p>
<p>
Stock a winter kit at home and in your bag. Learn the bus snow routes. Embrace micro-errands—everything is close, weather permitting.

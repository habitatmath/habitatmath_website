        <!-- QUIBDÓ, COLOMBIA -->
<h1>Quibdó – Jungle rivers, thunderous skies, endless green</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  Capital of Colombia’s Chocó Department, Quibdó sits on the Atrato River and wears green like a uniform. 
  City population is about <span class="metric">~120,000</span>. Streets pulse with Afro-Colombian culture, marimba rhythms, 
  and river trade. Markets brim with plantains, fish, cacao, and stories.
</p>
<p>
  Rain defines life here. Boats are buses; umbrellas are personalities. Heat is steady and sociable. Air stays fresh at 
  <span class="metric">AQI 10–25</span>, rinsed daily by the sky. The cathedral anchors the center; the river sets the tempo.
</p>
<p>
  Visitors come for biodiversity, culture, and the feeling of being hugged by rainforest. “Remote” is part of the charm.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
  One of the world’s wettest cities: annual rainfall often exceeds <span class="metric">7,000–8,000 mm</span>. 
  Rainy days can surpass <span class="metric">~300/yr</span>. Downpours are torrential, frequent, and oddly comforting.
</p>
<p>
  Temperatures are stable—daytime highs <span class="metric">29–31 °C</span>, nights <span class="metric">23–24 °C</span>. 
  Humidity averages <span class="metric">85–95%</span>. Sunshine appears between storms; rainbow count is non-trivial.
</p>
<p>
  Thunderstorms are common. Flooding can affect low-lying streets; locals read clouds like headlines.
</p>

<h2>🛶 Getting Around</h2>
<p>
  Mototaxis, tuk-tuks, and river boats do the heavy lifting. City trips are short and inexpensive; typical rides cost 
  <span class="metric">COP $3,000–8,000</span>. Walkable core; watch for slick surfaces after rain.
</p>
<p>
  Quibdó’s Reyes Murillo Airport connects to Medellín and Bogotá with <span class="metric">daily</span> flights; 
  the runways know rain intimately. Road access exists but weather can change travel times.
</p>
<p>
  River transport links communities up and down the Atrato. Schedules mirror water levels more than clocks.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays & Daily Costs</h2>
<p>
  Simple guesthouses from <span class="metric">COP $60,000/night</span>. Mid-range hotels 
  <span class="metric">COP $150,000–250,000/night</span>. Rates jump for festivals like San Pacho.
</p>
<p>
  Meals are hearty and local: fish with coconut rice <span class="metric">COP $18,000–28,000</span>, 
  street arepas <span class="metric">COP $3,000–5,000</span>, coffee <span class="metric">COP $3,000–6,000</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Guided river/forest outings range <span class="metric">COP $80,000–250,000</span>. Daily visitor budget 
  <span class="metric">COP $120,000–220,000</span> without big tours.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
  Central 1-bed rent <span class="metric">COP $900,000–1,400,000/mo</span>. Utilities with constant humidity 
  <span class="metric">COP $200,000–350,000</span>. Home internet <span class="metric">20–60 Mbps</span> for 
  <span class="metric">COP $70,000–120,000</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Groceries for two: <span class="metric">COP $700,000–1,000,000/mo</span>, less if you live market-first. 
  Commutes are short—typically <span class="metric">10–20 min</span>. Tap water quality varies; most residents use filtered or bottled.
</p>
<p>
  QOL is rainforest-centric: loud rain, lush mornings, sociable evenings. Power and connectivity are fine most days, 
  with occasional weather-related blips.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Safety is neighborhood-specific; take local advice seriously. Keep valuables discreet and move with purpose. 
  Night travel: use known rides and routes.
</p>
<p>
  Clinics and hospitals serve the city; bring essentials and meds, as supplies can fluctuate. Pharmacies cover basics; 
  travel insurance is smart, evacuation coverage smarter.
</p>
<p>
  Admin is straightforward but slower in heavy rain or holidays. Patience and copies go far. Respect river conditions; heed local guidance.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  Come for San Pacho (Sept–Oct) if you want music, dance, and color at max volume. Hire certified local guides for river trips. 
  Waterproof everything—phone, backpack, mood.
</p>
<p>
  Wear quick-dry clothing and closed-toe shoes with grip. Mosquito defense is a daily habit. Market mornings are photogenic and delicious.
</p>
<p>
  Ask before photographing people and ceremonies. Learn a few greetings; smiles arrive faster than rain.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Prioritize ventilation, dehumidifiers, and mold-resistant paint. Secure high shelves and dry boxes for gear. 
  Roof maintenance is a quarterly ritual, not a chore.
</p>
<p>
  Keep a rain-go bag by the door: poncho, headlamp, dry bag, cash. Build relationships with neighbors and boat drivers—local intel beats apps.
</p>
<p>
  Embrace the rhythm: errands between squalls, long dinners when thunder drums, river breezes for perspective.

 <!-- BOSTON -->
<h1>Boston – Brains by the Charles, chowder by the harbor</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  Boston proper has <span class="metric">~675,000 residents</span>; the metro tops <span class="metric">4.9M</span>. 
  Red-brick history meets biotech money, baseball myths, and lecture halls. 
  AQI sits at a civilized <span class="metric">25–40</span>; spring pollen occasionally votes otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  Neighborhoods have accents and opinions: Back Bay polished, South End foodie, Cambridge bookish, 
  Allston student-loud, Seaport glassy. The Charles River path runs <span class="metric">~37 km</span> of cardio democracy.
</p>
<p>
  Walkability is strong in the core; blocks ignore grids and reward wanderers. 
  Fall colors deserve their own calendar invite.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
  Four honest seasons. Winters bring <span class="metric">~30–50</span> sub-zero mornings and 
  <span class="metric">25–35</span> snow days; snowfall swings from “dusting” to “Nor’easter saga,” 
  averaging <span class="metric">110–130 cm/yr</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Summers run <span class="metric">25–29 °C</span> with occasional <span class="metric">32 °C+</span> spikes. 
  Annual precipitation <span class="metric">1,000–1,100 mm</span> over <span class="metric">120–130</span> wet days. 
  Sunshine totals around <span class="metric">2,500 h</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Spring is flirtatious; autumn is the main event. Sea breeze cools heat, amplifies wind chill.
</p>

<h2>🚊 Public Transit Snapshot</h2>
<p>
  The MBTA runs subway (“T”), commuter rail, buses, ferries. 
  Rapid transit has <span class="metric">4</span> main lines, <span class="metric">~105</span> stations; peak headways <span class="metric">4–6 min</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Monthly LinkPass around <span class="metric">$90</span> (subway + bus). Commuter rail passes scale by zone. 
  Logan Airport to downtown by SL1 in <span class="metric">15–25 min</span>; water taxi is the scenic flex.
</p>
<p>
  Bluebikes share puts <span class="metric">4500+</span> bikes at <span class="metric">450+</span> stations. 
  Streets are tight; patience > horn.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Getting There & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>
  Logan Airport sits essentially across the harbor; the Silver Line is free inbound from terminals. 
  Amtrak ties NYC in <span class="metric">~3 h 45</span> (Acela faster).
</p>
<p>
  Hotels aren’t shy: mid-range <span class="metric">$220–340/night</span>, boutique/luxe from <span class="metric">$400+</span>. 
  Hostels are scarce; book early in semester and marathon windows.
</p>
<p>
  Coffee <span class="metric">$3.5–5</span>, lobster roll <span class="metric">$22–35</span>, North End pasta that ruins future pasta. 
  Daily visitor budget without Fenway tickets: <span class="metric">$110–180</span>.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
  1-bed central: <span class="metric">$2,800–3,600/mo</span>; Somerville/JP/Allston <span class="metric">$2,200–2,900</span>. 
  Utilities with winter heat <span class="metric">$150–230/mo</span>. Internet <span class="metric">300–1,000 Mbps</span> for <span class="metric">$60–90</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Groceries for two: <span class="metric">$650–900/mo</span>. Commutes average <span class="metric">25–45 min</span>. 
  Sidewalk snow etiquette: shovel early, salt generously, don’t be that neighbor.
</p>
<p>
  QOL is high if you like brainy bustle and brick sidewalks. Libraries and museums punch well above weight.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Safety is solid in most neighborhoods; late-night caution where nightlife clusters. 
  Hospitals form a medical galaxy—MGH, Brigham, BCH. ER waits exist; care is top-tier.
</p>
<p>
  Universities? A constellation—Harvard, MIT, BU, Northeastern, and friends. 
  Bureaucracy is normal US flavor; parking permits are the true capstone exam.
</p>
<p>
  Storm prep matters: know street-sweeping, snow-emergency routes, and when your car becomes a traffic cone.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  Walk the Freedom Trail early, eat the North End late. 
  Ride the ferry to Charlestown for USS Constitution and skyline photos without elbows.
</p>
<p>
  Book museum slots on rainy days—everyone else will too. 
  For views, skip the line at the Pru with a well-timed library rooftop instead.
</p>
<p>
  Chase foliage in the Public Garden or hop a commuter rail to Concord for a quick leaf-therapy session.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Rent near the line you actually ride—Green-Line dreams meet Green-Line realities. 
  Buy real winter boots; fashion forgives, slush does not.
</p>
<p>
  Share a CSAs/market haul to beat grocery prices. 
  Learn your street-cleaning calendar like it’s a midterm. 
  And accept that every third friend is in a grad program—use it for free lectures.

    <!-- RIO DE JANEIRO -->
<h1>Rio de Janeiro – Where mountains meet samba</h1>

<h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
<p>Rio packs drama into daily life. <span class="metric">City pop ≈ 6.7M</span>; metro is far larger. Beaches like Copacabana and Ipanema headline, but neighborhoods carry the plot. The city logs <span class="metric">280+ sunshine days</span>, which explains the relentless beach volleyball. Christ the Redeemer watches from <span class="metric">710 m</span> like a calm lifeguard. Sugarloaf’s cable car turns commutes into postcards.</p>
<p>Air feels fresher near the sea: <span class="metric">AQI 35–45</span> most days. Carnival swells crowds to <span class="metric">~2M/day</span> at peak—glitter becomes a basic need. Street art is everywhere; so are juice bars that treat açaí like a food group. Cariocas own the sidewalk like it’s a catwalk.</p>
<p>It’s pretty, yes. It’s also real. Rio blends modern metro lines with old-school trams. One minute it’s bossa nova, next it’s bus horn. That contrast is the charm.</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>Summer brings heat and theatrics. Highs hit <span class="metric">32–38 °C</span>; sea breezes cool the edges. Rain concentrates Dec–Mar with <span class="metric">~1,200 mm/yr</span>. Thunderstorms roll in, selfie sticks roll away. Sunshine still clears <span class="metric">2,800 h/yr</span>.</p>
<p>Winters are polite: afternoons hover near <span class="metric">22–24 °C</span>. Sub-zero days: <span class="metric">0</span>. Humidity averages <span class="metric">~75%</span>, hair has opinions.</p>
<p>Heat waves happen a few times each year; hydrate and chase shade. Ocean temps run <span class="metric">22–26 °C</span>. UV is serious: peak index <span class="metric">10–12</span>.</p>

<h2>🚇 Trains, Buses & Bay Crossings</h2>
<p>MetrôRio runs <span class="metric">~58 km</span> over 3 lines with <span class="metric">40+ stations</span>. Peak headways <span class="metric">2–4 min</span>. On-time rates hover near <span class="metric">~90%</span>. Single fare about <span class="metric">R$ 6.90</span>; reloadable cards save time.</p>
<p>VLT tram stitches Centro and the port with <span class="metric">3 lines</span>. Ferries cross Guanabara Bay in <span class="metric">20–25 min</span> and double as skyline tours. Bus network is massive: <span class="metric">440+ routes</span>; traffic decides your mood.</p>
<p>Bike lanes exceed <span class="metric">450 km</span>. Night service exists but thins late. Airport links: BRT/Metro combos from GIG, typical <span class="metric">40–60 min</span>.</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Arrivals & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>Hotels swing with the season. Mid-range runs <span class="metric">R$ 450–750/night</span> in Ipanema/Leme; hostels from <span class="metric">R$ 80–150</span>. Carnival/New Year surge <span class="metric">+40–80%</span>. Book early; ocean views don’t multiply.</p>
<p>GIG airport is <span class="metric">~20 km</span> from the South Zone. Premium taxi to Copacabana <span class="metric">R$ 120–180</span>. BRT + Metro is cheaper and often faster at rush.</p>
<p>Eat happy on a budget. Prato feito lunches <span class="metric">R$ 25–40</span>. Mid-range dinner for two <span class="metric">R$ 160–260</span>. Espresso <span class="metric">R$ 6–10</span>; coconut water <span class="metric">R$ 8–12</span> straight from the source.</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Central/South Zone 1BR rents <span class="metric">R$ 3,500–6,000/mo</span>. Groceries for two <span class="metric">R$ 1,500–2,200/mo</span>. Utilities in summer with A/C <span class="metric">R$ 350–650</span>. 200 Mbps internet <span class="metric">R$ 100–160</span>.</p>
<p>Commutes vary wildly: <span class="metric">35–70 min</span> typical cross-town. Green space is lavish—Lagoa loop is <span class="metric">7.5 km</span> of cardio with views. Tap water is treated; many still use filters.</p>
<p>QOL soars if you live near what you love—beach, bay, or Tijuca trails. Noise averages <span class="metric">60–65 dB</span> in busy zones; Sundays exhale.</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>Safety is area-specific. Stay street-smart. Avoid empty beaches after dark. Keep phones discreet. Tourist zones have extra patrols.</p>
<p>Private hospitals are excellent; public system varies. ER waits fluctuate with heat and holidays. Travel/expat insurance is not optional, it’s sanity.</p>
<p>Paperwork takes patience—CPF, bank, SIM, sometimes in that order. Universities and language schools add a strong student vibe. Portuguese opens doors faster than any keycard.</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>Go early to Christ and Sugarloaf; fog and lines are real. Use the red tourist buses once for orientation, then switch to Metro/ferry. Learn the beach flag code; currents don’t care about confidence.</p>
<p>Try a feijoada Saturday lunch and a Sunday Lagoa bike. Watch belongings on the sand; rent chairs from kiosks—they keep an eye out. For views, Morro da Urca at sunset is chef’s kiss.</p>
<p>Cashless works in most places; keep small cash for kiosks. Sunscreen before breakfast. Caipirinhas after.</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>Choose location over square meters. Copacabana is practical; Ipanema/Leblon feel resort-daily; Botafogo balances budget and bay. Test A/C, water pressure, and cell signal before signing.</p>
<p>Commute against the flow if possible. Learn basic Portuguese fast—service life gets 50% easier. Build a safety routine you repeat without thinking.</p>
<p>Find your hill trail and your beach kiosk; both are therapy. And yes, buy the cheap umbrella—storms love surprise entrances.</p>

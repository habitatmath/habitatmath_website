    <!-- TOKYO -->
<h1>Tokyo — Neon calm, monk-level punctuality, endless noodles</h1>

<h2>First Impressions & City Pulse</h2>
<p>
Tokyo is a paradox that works. <span class="metric">Metro population ≈ 37M</span>. It hums, yet it’s gentle. Vending machines outnumber stress points. Alleys hide Michelin stars and budget bowls. Skyscrapers share space with shrines. Everyone has somewhere to be; no one bumps you getting there.
</p>
<p>
Neighborhoods feel like distinct planets. Shibuya flashes; Yanaka whispers. Kichijoji sells weekend happiness in park form. Stations are micro-cities with food courts better than most cities’ downtowns. Convenience stores are, well, convenient—and weirdly gourmet.
</p>
<p>
Air is clean for a megacity: <span class="metric">AQI ~25–40</span>. Sidewalks are spotless without signs yelling about it. Cash still matters, but cards and IC cards win. Politeness is policy, not performance.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
Four true seasons, dramatic costume changes. Summers run warm and humid: <span class="metric">Jul–Aug highs ≈ 30–33 °C</span>. Winters are crisp and mostly dry: <span class="metric">Jan lows ≈ 1–3 °C</span>. Snow shows up a few times: <span class="metric">snowfall days ≈ 5–10/yr</span>.
</p>
<p>
Rain is frequent but brief. <span class="metric">Annual precipitation ≈ 1,500 mm</span>. <span class="metric">Rainy days ≈ 100–120/yr</span>. Sunshine holds steady at <span class="metric">~1,900 h/yr</span>. Typhoon season brings theatrical downpours; the city shrugs and keeps schedules.
</p>
<p>
Cherry blossoms peak late March to early April. Momijigari (autumn colors) hit Nov. Heat advisories pop some years: <span class="metric">>35 °C days ≈ 5–10/yr</span>. Winters have few freezes: <span class="metric">sub-zero days ≈ 5–10/yr</span>.
</p>

<h2>🚆 Trains, Subways & Everything Between</h2>
<p>
The rail map looks like knitwear. <span class="metric">900+ stations</span> in the greater web. Subway alone has <span class="metric">13 Tokyo Metro + 4 Toei lines</span> and <span class="metric">~300 stations</span>. On-time performance is legendary: <span class="metric">~98–99%</span>. Peak headways are a blink: <span class="metric">2–3 min</span>.
</p>
<p>
IC cards rule: <span class="metric">Suica/PASMO</span> tap everywhere, even vending machines. Day tickets are cheap: <span class="metric">¥600–900</span> for subway 24-hour passes. Airport links are fast: <span class="metric">HND→central 13–20 min</span>, <span class="metric">NRT→Ueno 36 min (Skyliner)</span> or <span class="metric">Tokyo 60 min (N’EX)</span>.
</p>
<p>
Buses fill fine-grain gaps. Late trains run late, but they still run. Bike lanes exist in patches; side streets are cyclist heaven. Taxis are spotless, pricey, door opens by itself—don’t fight it.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Arrivals & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>
Choice overload: business hotels, ryokan, capsules. <span class="metric">Mid-range hotel ¥12,000–20,000/night</span>. <span class="metric">Capsules/hostels ¥3,000–5,000</span>. Book early for cherry blossoms and New Year.
</p>
<p>
Arrivals are painless. <span class="metric">HND</span> is the easy airport; <span class="metric">NRT</span> is farther but swift by rail. Luggage forwarding costs <span class="metric">~¥2,000–3,000</span> per bag and saves your back.
</p>
<p>
Eat gloriously on a budget. <span class="metric">Lunch sets ¥900–1,200</span>. <span class="metric">Dinner for two mid-range ¥5,000–8,000</span>. Coffee <span class="metric">¥350–500</span>. Daily visitor budget <span class="metric">¥9,000–15,000</span> without splurges.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
Central 1BR rents <span class="metric">¥150,000–230,000/mo</span>. Groceries for two <span class="metric">¥35,000–55,000/mo</span>. Utilities <span class="metric">¥8,000–12,000</span>. Internet <span class="metric">1 Gbps ¥4,000–6,000</span>.
</p>
<p>
Commutes average <span class="metric">45–60 min</span>, but the time is organized and quiet. Parks are strategic, not sprawling; find your local. Water is safe; tap tastes fine.
</p>
<p>
QOL is high if you like order. Convenience stores act like tiny kitchens. ATMs 24/7 at konbini. Earthquake codes are strict; alerts ping phones, not nerves.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
Safety index is high; violent crime is rare. Lost phones come back. Scams exist but politeness usually wins. Night walks are normal in most wards.
</p>
<p>
Healthcare is excellent. Co-pay is typically <span class="metric">30%</span> under national insurance. Clinics are everywhere; bring cash/card and your health card. Pharmacies are efficient, multilingual signage improving.
</p>
<p>
Paperwork loves precision. Register address, get your <span class="metric">MyNumber</span>, open bank with patience. Residence cards smooth everything. Universities are many; international programs growing.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
Start early; mornings are yours. Reserve popular sushi; lines are a sport. Use lockers at stations to roam light. Learn basic phrases; effort gets smiles.
</p>
<p>
Avoid rush hour trains with luggage. For views, choose the free Tokyo Metropolitan Government observatory; pay for Skytree if you want the full drama. Always have cash for tiny ramen shops.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
Pick a rail line you love; your life will orbit it. South-facing units get better winter light. Buy a dehumidifier; summers are earnest.
</p>
<p>
Batch errands around stations. Set up delivery lockers. Join neighborhood matsuri; community appears fast once you show up.

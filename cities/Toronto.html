<!-- TORONTO -->
<body>
  <h1>Toronto — Lake breeze, layered neighborhoods, global rhythm</h1>

  <h2>City Pulse</h2>
  <p>
    Toronto is Canada’s biggest city with <span class="metric">~2.8 million</span> residents and a metro of <span class="metric">~6.7 million</span>, stitched together by streetcars, subways, and a long waterfront. 
    The skyline is anchored by the CN Tower and a forest of new builds adding <span class="metric">10k–20k</span> units most years. 
    Air quality is friendly at <span class="metric">AQI 15–30</span> on typical days, helped by lake winds and strict emissions rules. 
    The city speaks in <span class="metric">180+ languages</span> and serves food from basically all of them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Summers flip to patio mode with <span class="metric">~2,050 sun-hours/year</span>; winters test your layering game for <span class="metric">~80–90</span> sub-zero days. 
    Downtown bike lanes now span roughly <span class="metric">600+ km</span> across the city, with more popping up each season. 
    Tech and media keep office towers busy; film crews close streets with delightful regularity. 
    Houseboats, ferries, and island beaches make it feel resort-adjacent from May to September. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Property is pricey, but parks are generous: High Park’s <span class="metric">~400 acres</span> and a lakeshore trail stretching <span class="metric">~56 km</span> are free daily therapy. 
    The vibe is confident, calm, and quietly competitive—just like its hockey fans. 
  </p>

  <h2>Move, Glide, Connect </h2>
  <p>
    The TTC runs <span class="metric">4</span> subway lines across <span class="metric">~76 stations</span>, with peak headways of <span class="metric">2–5 min</span>. 
    Streetcars tick along <span class="metric">10+</span> routes; bus coverage is citywide with <span class="metric">24-hour</span> Night Network lines. 
    A monthly adult pass is <span class="metric">$156 CAD</span> and the PRESTO card unifies fares across most regional services. 
    Real-time arrivals are solid and improving; elevators and platform edge doors are expanding station by station. 
  </p>
  <p>
    GO Transit pulls the region tight with <span class="metric">7</span> commuter rail corridors and express buses; Union Station sees <span class="metric">250k+</span> daily movements. 
    The UP Express links Pearson airport to downtown in <span class="metric">25 min</span>, running every <span class="metric">15 min</span>. 
    Bike-share counts <span class="metric">10k+</span> bikes at <span class="metric">>800</span> stations, and new protected lanes have cut some core travel times. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Punctuality sits in the mid-<span class="metric">90%</span> range off-peak and a notch lower at rush; weekend diversions are common during upgrades. 
    Ferries to the Toronto Islands carry <span class="metric">~1 million</span> riders a year—part transit, part mini-holiday. 
    If you must drive, expect <span class="metric">30–50 min</span> commutes; if you don’t, plan life along a frequent corridor and you’re golden. 
  </p>

  <h2>Seasons in HD </h2>
  <p>
    Winter starts crisp and can bite: average highs <span class="metric">−1–3 °C</span>, with <span class="metric">~40–50</span> snowfall days and totals around <span class="metric">120–140 cm</span>. 
    Lake effect brings quick bursts; sidewalks clear fast on main routes. 
    Golden, blue-sky days happen even in February—and they save morale. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Spring is dramatic: tulips, thaw, and a temperature rollercoaster from <span class="metric">5–18 °C</span>. 
    Rain adds up to <span class="metric">~800–900 mm/year</span> across <span class="metric">~120</span> wet days, but many showers are brief. 
    UV climbs quickly by May; patios wake up right on cue. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Summer runs warm at <span class="metric">24–29 °C</span> with heat alerts during spikes above <span class="metric">32 °C</span>; lake breezes rescue evenings. 
    Sunshine totals near <span class="metric">2,050 h</span>, perfect for island swims and waterfront rides. 
    Thunderstorms roll through fast, clearing the air and your calendar. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Autumn wins beauty contests: highs <span class="metric">10–18 °C</span>, low humidity, long golden hours, and knockout foliage in High Park and the ravines. 
    If you want one month to fall in love with Toronto, circle October. 
  </p>

  <h2>Touchdown, Check-in, and Daily Spend (the easy-come plan)</h2>
  <p>
    Pearson (YYZ) sits <span class="metric">~25 km</span> from downtown with the UP Express at <span class="metric">15-min</span> intervals; Billy Bishop (YTZ) puts you right on the waterfront. 
    Intercity rail shoots to Niagara, Ottawa, and Montréal; buses fill in cross-border and regional hops. 
    Driving in from the 401/427/Gardiner is straightforward—traffic chooses your mood, so pick your hour. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Hotels land around <span class="metric">$200–300 CAD/night</span> mid-range, budget stays <span class="metric">$120–180</span>, and luxe from <span class="metric">$350+</span>. 
    Short-term rentals vary by regulation—downtown condos often sit at <span class="metric">$140–220/night</span>. 
    Coffee is <span class="metric">$3–5</span>, a solid lunch <span class="metric">$14–22</span>, and a transit day-pass alternative is the daily max fare cap. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A sensible day without splurges runs <span class="metric">$90–170 CAD</span>. 
    Wi-Fi is strong in cafés and libraries; typical speeds <span class="metric">100–1000 Mbps</span>. 
    Laptop-friendly corners: Stackt, Union Market tables, and the many university cafés that quietly welcome civilians. 
  </p>

  <h2>Rentals, Paperwork, Health & Campus Life (the living core)</h2>
  <p>
    Downtown 1-bed rents sit at <span class="metric">$2,200–2,900 CAD/mo</span>; strong outer-area options run <span class="metric">$1,700–2,200</span>. 
    Expect deposits of <span class="metric">first + last month</span> and references; vacancy hovers near the low single digits. 
    Utilities add <span class="metric">$150–220</span> and internet <span class="metric">$50–80</span>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Healthcare is anchored by UHN, St. Michael’s, and Sunnybrook; OHIP covers residents, private plans fill gaps for newcomers. 
    Universities—U of T, TMU, York—pull a student population of <span class="metric">150k+</span>. 
    City services are increasingly digital; most permits and registrations start online. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Quality of life is powered by parks, libraries, and community centres—many with <span class="metric">$0–$20</span> classes. 
    Commute medians land around <span class="metric">30–40 min</span>; pick housing by your transit corridor and you’ll feel richer. 
  </p>

  <h2>Safety, Community, and Play (fitting in fast)</h2>
  <p>
    Toronto’s overall safety index sits in the high <span class="metric">70s</span> with very low violent-crime rates for a city this size. 
    Busy hubs can mean pickpockets—zippers help. 
    Winter sidewalks are salted; lakefront paths can ice in cold snaps. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Integration is easy: join rec leagues, maker spaces, or neighborhood Discords. 
    You’ll find <span class="metric">1000s</span> of meetups across tech, art, running, and food every month. 
    City festivals—TIFF, Pride, Caribana—turn newcomers into locals fast. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Recreation spans <span class="metric">>80</span> outdoor rinks, <span class="metric">>50</span> pools, and a trail network that threads ravines you didn’t know existed. 
    Bring shoes you actually like walking in; your step count will thank you. 
  </p>

  <h2>Traveler Tricks (make 48 hours sing)</h2>
  <p>
    Morning ferry to the Islands, picnic with skyline views, and a sunset back through the harbor—costs little, feels deluxe. 
    Book CN Tower EdgeWalk if you crave adrenaline; otherwise the Aquarium is a weather-proof win. 
    Kensington, Ossington, and St. Lawrence Market cover snacks from <span class="metric">50+</span> countries in one afternoon. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the TTC day fare cap instead of individual tickets if you plan three or more rides. 
    For panoramas, slip into University of Toronto campuses—quads and towers are photogenic and peaceful. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Day trips: Niagara Falls in <span class="metric">2 h</span>, Blue Mountain in <span class="metric">2 h</span>, wine country in between. 
    Pack layers—Toronto loves fast weather plot twists. 
  </p>

  <h2>Resident Wisdom (long-game comfort)</h2>
  <p>
    Choose your line first, apartment second; living near frequent transit is like giving yourself a raise. 
    Consider neighborhoods by noise curve—King West parties; Roncesvalles whispers; Leslieville splits the difference. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Winter kit: boots with grip, a real parka, and a vitamin-D plan for <span class="metric">Nov–Feb</span>. 
    Summer kit: a bike lock, a picnic blanket, and a Presto card with auto-reload. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For sanity: one park you love, one café where they learn your name, and one community you show up for weekly. 
    Toronto turns into a village surprisingly fast.

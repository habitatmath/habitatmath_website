        <!-- BERN -->
<h1>Bern – Clockwork calm, river curves, zero drama</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  Switzerland’s capital keeps it quiet and clever. The Aare loops like a turquoise ribbon around a tidy core.

<p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Safety index is excellent; violent crime is rare. 
  Police and EMS are responsive and professional. 
  Hospitals rate highly; wait times are predictable, not theatrical.
</p>
<p>
  Public schools are strong; universities nearby boost research and culture. 
  Bureaucracy likes neat folders—appointments run on time, documents in order get smiles.
</p>
<p>
  Foreigners: register within the required window, bring copies, and breathe. 
  Health insurance is mandatory; premiums vary, coverage is robust.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  Swim the Aare in summer with a dry bag and local advice; it’s a rite of passage. 
  Climb the Münster tower for views. Einstein House for the nerdy grin. 
  Use a day pass and ride trams like a local.
</p>
<p>
  Sunday is quiet—plan hikes or museums. 
  Picnic under the arcades if it rains; Bern invented weather-proof strolling. 
  Chocolate shops are traps; enjoy the ambush.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Pick a flat near a tram stop; winter will thank you. 
  Learn recycling rules; your bins have expectations. 
  Buy an annual pass if you roam the region—SBB discounts stack well.
</p>
<p>
  River routine: Aare float in summer, Gurten walks in shoulder seasons. 
  Book medical and admin slots early; “walk-in” is not a lifestyle here.

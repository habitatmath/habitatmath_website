<!-- MUNICH -->
<body>
  <h1>Munich — Biergartens, bikes, and Bavarian precision</h1>

  <h2>First Impressions (beyond the postcard)</h2>
  <p>
    Munich, Bavaria’s capital, is home to around <span class="metric">1.58 million</span> people and serves as Germany’s southern powerhouse for tech, finance, and culture. 
    The metro region counts <span class="metric">~6 million</span>, anchored by clean streets, efficient transit, and immaculate parks. 
    Average AQI hovers around <span class="metric">20–30</span>, thanks to strict emissions controls and a cycling culture that sees <span class="metric">~18% of commutes</span> by bike. 
    The skyline mixes Gothic towers like the Frauenkirche with slick glass HQs for BMW, Siemens, and Allianz. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Munich enjoys <span class="metric">2,300+ sun-hours/year</span>, giving life to its <span class="metric">>1,000</span> beer gardens and cafés. 
    Population density runs at <span class="metric">4,700/km²</span>, but green space is abundant—English Garden alone covers <span class="metric">375 ha</span>. 
    Walkability scores high; most errands in the core can be done on foot in <span class="metric">10–15 min</span>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a city of contrasts: lederhosen in the subway during Oktoberfest, followed by suits tapping away in coworking hubs. 
    If orderliness had a capital, this would be it—but with plenty of room for spontaneous riverside picnics. 
  </p>

  <h2>Rolling Right Through (Munich’s transit ways)</h2>
  <p>
    MVV runs a seamless web of U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams, and buses covering <span class="metric">~530 lines</span>. 
    U-Bahn alone spans <span class="metric">8 lines</span> and <span class="metric">~100 km</span> of track, with trains every <span class="metric">2–5 min</span> in peak. 
    Monthly passes start around <span class="metric">€60–€70</span> for inner zones, with discounts for students and seniors. 
  </p>
  <p>
    S-Bahn connects the region via <span class="metric">8 lines</span> radiating from the city core, linking towns within <span class="metric">50–60 km</span>. 
    Punctuality averages above <span class="metric">95%</span> off-peak; weekend closures happen during major works but replacement buses are dependable. 
    Cycling infrastructure includes <span class="metric">1,200+ km</span> of bike lanes, and bike-share stations pepper all districts. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Munich Airport sits <span class="metric">~35 km</span> out, reachable in <span class="metric">40–45 min</span> via S1/S8. 
    Trams, many of them heritage models, double as moving city tours. 
    If you time it right, you can hop a suburban train to the Alps in under <span class="metric">90 min</span>. 
  </p>

  <h2>Seasons with Character</h2>
  <p>
    Winters are cold but rarely brutal: highs hover <span class="metric">1–4 °C</span>, with <span class="metric">~40–50</span> snow days totaling <span class="metric">~100 cm</span>. 
    Föhn winds occasionally sweep in warm spells, making it feel like spring in January. 
    Christmas markets light up Marienplatz and Viktualienmarkt, pulling locals outdoors despite the chill. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Spring ranges <span class="metric">8–18 °C</span> and comes with a rush of blooms in English Garden. 
    Rainfall averages <span class="metric">~950 mm/year</span>, spread over <span class="metric">~120 wet days</span>, so a light jacket is year-round gear. 
    Sunshine jumps notably by April, flipping park culture into high gear. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Summers are warm but comfortable: highs <span class="metric">22–27 °C</span>, with <span class="metric">~7–8</span> hot days above <span class="metric">30 °C</span>. 
    Beer gardens overflow, Isar River banks turn into sunbathing strips, and open-air cinemas pop up all over. 
    Thunderstorms are frequent but short-lived, scrubbing the air fresh. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Autumn is crisp with highs <span class="metric">10–16 °C</span> and postcard-perfect foliage along the Isar. 
    Oktoberfest draws <span class="metric">~6 million</span> visitors; book accommodations months ahead if you’re coming then. 
  </p>

  <h2>Arrivals, Beds, and Daily Outlay</h2>
  <p>
    Munich Airport handles <span class="metric">>47 million</span> passengers/year and connects directly to the city via two S-Bahn lines. 
    Long-distance trains link Berlin in <span class="metric">~4 h</span>, Vienna in <span class="metric">~4 h</span>, and Zurich in <span class="metric">~4.5 h</span>. 
    The Autobahn offers scenic (and sometimes speedy) drives in all directions. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Mid-range hotels run <span class="metric">€110–150/night</span>, budget stays <span class="metric">€70–100</span>, and luxury from <span class="metric">€200+</span>. 
    Short-term rentals average <span class="metric">€90–140/night</span> in central areas. 
    Coffee is <span class="metric">€3–4</span>, lunch plates <span class="metric">€12–18</span>, and a hearty dinner <span class="metric">€20–35</span>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A moderate daily spend sits between <span class="metric">€90–160</span>. 
    Wi-Fi speeds average <span class="metric">50–200 Mbps</span> in hotels and cafés. 
    Laptop-friendly corners include Man Versus Machine and Standl 20. 
  </p>

  <h2>Housing, Healthcare, Education, Bureaucracy</h2>
  <p>
    Central 1-bed rents are <span class="metric">€1,200–1,700/mo</span>, with outer areas <span class="metric">€900–1,200</span>. 
    Deposit norms are <span class="metric">3 months’ rent</span>; housing supply is tight with vacancy under <span class="metric">1%</span>. 
    Utilities average <span class="metric">€150–220</span>/mo, internet around <span class="metric">€35–50</span>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Healthcare is world-class under Germany’s public and private insurance models. 
    Universities—LMU and TUM—host <span class="metric">>90,000</span> students combined. 
    Most municipal paperwork now has online portals, though in-person appointments are still common. 
  </p>
  <p>
    COL is high by German standards but QOL is top-tier—parks, culture, and efficient services more than earn it. 
    Commutes average <span class="metric">25–35 min</span> in the metro core. 
  </p>

  <h2>Safety, Socializing, and Play</h2>
  <p>
    Safety index ranks in the high <span class="metric">80s</span>; violent crime is rare. 
    Biking after dark is common thanks to well-lit paths and low crime risk. 
    Public spaces feel secure at almost all hours. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Social integration is smooth for German speakers but expat groups thrive—Meetup counts <span class="metric">100+</span> active communities. 
    Cultural calendar is busy year-round, from operas to techno nights. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Recreation includes <span class="metric">>50</span> museums, <span class="metric">>20</span> major festivals, and Alpine trails an hour away. 
    City sports clubs are affordable and community-focused. 
  </p>

  <h2>Tourist Hacks</h2>
  <p>
    Visit Viktualienmarkt for local flavors; carry cash for smaller stalls. 
    Cycle the English Garden and stop at the Eisbach wave to watch surfers. 
    The €49 Deutschlandticket can be a steal if you’re exploring beyond the city. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Use early mornings to see Marienplatz before crowds. 
    Sunday is museum discount day in many spots—often just €1 entry. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Day trips: Neuschwanstein Castle (<span class="metric">~2 h</span>), Salzburg (<span class="metric">~1.5 h</span>), and Garmisch for skiing (<span class="metric">~1.5 h</span>). 
  </p>

  <h2>Living Smarts</h2>
  <p>
    Learn basic German phrases—politeness matters here. 
    Buy seasonal transit passes if you’re a regular traveler; they save more than you expect. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Winter kit: solid boots and a warm coat; summer kit: swimwear for the Isar and a picnic set. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Anchor yourself in a neighborhood café; locals warm up quickly to familiar faces.

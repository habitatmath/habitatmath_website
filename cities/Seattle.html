 <!-- SEATTLE -->
<h1>Seattle – Coffee, code, and clouds with personality</h1>

<h2>City Pulse</h2>
<p>
  Emerald City runs on caffeine and curiosity. City headcount sits near <span class="metric">~750,000</span>; the metro tops 
  <span class="metric">~4.0M</span>. The skyline mixes glass needles and ferris-wheel smiles, with ferries gliding like clockwork.
</p>
<p>
  Neighborhoods have strong identities: Capitol Hill artsy, Ballard maritime, Fremont delightfully odd. 
  Waterfront parks stack views of the Olympics and Mount Rainier like postcards. AQI stays friendly at 
  <span class="metric">~20–35</span> most days.
</p>
<p>
  It’s outdoorsy by default—kayaks before breakfast, hiking boots by lunch, and a meet-up about databases after dinner.
</p>

<h2>🌤 Climate & Seasons</h2>
<p>
  Marine mood, gentle swings. Winter highs <span class="metric">7–10 °C</span>, summer highs 
  <span class="metric">22–28 °C</span>. Annual rainfall about <span class="metric">900–1,000 mm</span> across 
  <span class="metric">140–160 rainy days</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Sunshine lands around <span class="metric">1,900–2,200 h/yr</span>. Snow is an occasional plot twist: 
  <span class="metric">5–10 snow days/yr</span>, citywide excitement guaranteed. Sub-zero mornings 
  <span class="metric">10–20/yr</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Summers are famously glorious—dry, bright, and 9 pm sunsets. Autumn is sweater weather with maples on fire.
</p>

<h2>🚊 Public Transit Snapshot</h2>
<p>
  Link light rail connects the spine; extensions keep rolling. Current corridors cover 
  <span class="metric">~35–60 km</span> depending on segment, with headways <span class="metric">6–10 min</span> at peak.
</p>
<p>
  RapidRide buses fill the grid; ferries stitch the Sound. ORCA fares cap smartly; typical monthly spend for frequent riders 
  <span class="metric">$99–$135</span> depending on zones.
</p>
<p>
  SeaTac to downtown by rail in <span class="metric">~35–40 min</span>. Bike lanes exceed 
  <span class="metric">200+ miles</span>; protected stretches are growing.
</p>

<h2>🏨 Short Stays, Getting There & Daily Eats</h2>
<p>
  SeaTac sits <span class="metric">~19 km</span> south; Link or express bus gets you in fast. 
  Hotels: mid-range <span class="metric">$160–240/night</span>, boutique/luxe from <span class="metric">$300+</span>. 
  Hostels/private rooms <span class="metric">$60–120</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Coffee is a minor religion: espresso <span class="metric">$3.5–6</span>. Salmon tacos or pho lunch 
  <span class="metric">$12–18</span>. Dinner for two mid-range <span class="metric">$70–110</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Day budget without splurges: <span class="metric">$90–160</span>. CityPASS helps if you’re museum-heavy.
</p>

<h2>💰 Living Costs, QOL & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
  1-bed downtown/Capitol Hill <span class="metric">$2,200–3,000/mo</span>; outside core 
  <span class="metric">$1,700–2,300</span>. Utilities with mild A/C/heat <span class="metric">$140–220/mo</span>. 
  Internet <span class="metric">300–1,000 Mbps</span> for <span class="metric">$60–90</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Groceries for two <span class="metric">$650–1,000/mo</span>. Commutes average <span class="metric">25–45 min</span>; 
  water and hills shape routes. Tap water tastes mountain-fresh.
</p>
<p>
  QOL spikes if you love trails, transit, and tech meetups. Noise drops early; weekend farmers markets carry the vibe.
</p>

<h2>🛡 Safety, Health, Education & Paperwork</h2>
<p>
  Generally safe with big-city caveats: watch gear in tourist cores. EMS/hospitals are strong; major systems ring the core.
</p>
<p>
  Universities set the tone—UW and friends. Paperwork is standard US fare; car tabs and parking zones deserve a calendar reminder.
</p>
<p>
  Winter prep is boots + a real rain shell. Chains rarely, but handy for mountain weekends.
</p>

<h2>🧭 Tips for Tourists</h2>
<p>
  Ride a ferry just because. Time Pike Place before 10 am; see the market open, not just crowd. 
  Kerry Park for the classic skyline; add Gas Works for mood.
</p>
<p>
  If it drizzles, it drizzles—don’t umbrella-joust on narrow sidewalks. Seek indie roasters beyond the obvious mermaid.
</p>
<p>
  Day trips: Snoqualmie Falls, Bainbridge, Mount Rainier (seasonal roads). Save seafood splurges for places with local listings, not neon lures.
</p>

<h2>🏡 Tips for Long-Term Dwellers</h2>
<p>
  Live near your bus+rail combo; hills matter more than maps. Buy a dryer rack—rain wins sometimes. 
  Learn shoulder-season hiking; it’s the secret calendar.
</p>
<p>
  Build a ferry routine for sanity. Invest in waterproof shoes; your socks will write thank-you notes.
</p>
<p>
  Join a neighborhood council or trail group—Seattle bonds through projects and parks.
